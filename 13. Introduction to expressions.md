# 1.10 â€” Introduction to expressions

## Expressions

Consider the following series of statements:

```cpp
// five() is a function that returns the value 5
int five()
{
    return 5;
}
int main()
{
    int a{ 2 };             // initialize variable a with literal value 2
    int b{ 2 + 3 };         // initialize variable b with computed value 5
    int c{ (2 * 3) + 4 };   // initialize variable c with computed value 10
    int d{ b };             // initialize variable d with variable value 5
    int e{ five() };        // initialize variable e with function return value 5

    return 0;
}
```

- The initializers shown above make use of a variety of different constructs: **literals, variables, operators, and function calls.** 
- Somehow, **C++ is converting all of these different things into a single value** that can then be used as the **initialization value** for the variable.

- They all make use of an expression.

- An **expression** is a **combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that can be executed to produce a singular value**. 
- The **process of executing an expression** is called **evaluation**, and the **single value produced** is called **the result of the expression**.

- When an expression is evaluated, **each of the terms inside the expression are evaluated, until a single value remains**.
- Here are some examples of different kinds of expressions, with comments indicating how they evaluate:

```cpp
2               // 2 is a literal that evaluates to value 2
"Hello world!"  // "Hello world!" is a literal that evaluates to text "Hello world!"
x               // x is a variable that evaluates to the value of x
2 + 3           // operator+ combines values 2 and 3 to produce value 5
x = 2 + 3       // 2 + 3 evaluates to value 5, which is then assigned to variable x
std::cout << x  // x evaluates to the value of x, which is then printed to the console
five()          // evaluates to the return value of function five()
```

- Literals evaluate to their own values. 
- Variables evaluate to the value of the variable. 
- Function calls evaluate to whatever value the function returns. 
- And operators (such as operator+) let us combine multiple values together to produce a new value.

- Note that **expressions do not end in a semicolon**, and **cannot be compiled by themselves**. 
- For example, if you were to try compiling the expression *x = 5*, your compiler would complain (probably about a missing semicolon). Rather, **expressions are always evaluated as part of statements.**

For example, take this statement:

```cpp
int x{ 2 + 3 }; // 2 + 3 is an expression that has no semicolon -- the semicolon is at the end of the statement containing the expression
```

If you were to break this statement down into its syntax, it would look like this:

```cpp
type identifier { expression };
```

- ***Type* could be any valid type** (we chose *int*). ***Identifier* could be any valid name** (we chose *x*). And *e**xpression* could be any valid expression** (we chose *2 + 3*, which uses 2 literals and an operator).

> Wherever you can use a single value in C++, you can use an expression instead, and the expression will be evaluated to produce a single value.

## Expression statements

- **Expressions** must be **part of a statement**.

- We can use these expressions by themselves by **convert any expression into an equivalent statement** (called an expression statement). 
- An **expression statement** is **a statement that consists of an expression followed by a semicolon**. 
- When the **statement is executed**, the **expression will be evaluated** (and the **result of the expression will be discarded)**.

- Thus, we can take any **expression (such as *x = 5*)**, and turn it into an **expression statement (such as *x = 5;*)** that **will compile**.

> Values calculated in an expression are discarded at the end of the expression.
