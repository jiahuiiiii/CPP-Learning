# 5.7 — Logical operators

- Relational (comparison) operators can only test one condition at a time. 
- Often we need to know whether multiple conditions are true simultaneously. 
- Logical operators provide us with the capability to test multiple conditions.

- C++ has 3 logical operators:

  - | Operator    | Symbol | Form     | Operation                                       |
    | :---------- | :----- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
    | Logical NOT | !      | !x       | true if x is false, or false if x is true       |
    | Logical AND | &&     | x && y   | true if both x and y are true, false otherwise  |
    | Logical OR  | \|\|   | x \|\| y | true if either x or y are true, false otherwise |

## **Logical NOT**

| Operand | Result |
| :------ | :----- |
| !true   | false  |
| !false  | true   |

- ***logical NOT*** flips a Boolean value from true to false, and vice-versa.

- Logical NOT is often used in conditionals:

  ```cpp
  bool tooLarge { x > 100 }; // tooLarge is true if x > 100
  if (!tooLarge)
      // do something with x
  else
      // print an error
  ```

- *logical NOT* has a very **high level of precedence**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int y{ 7 };

    if (!x > y) //The correct way: (!( x > y ))
        std::cout << x << " is not greater than " << y << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << x << " is greater than " << y << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
5 is greater than 7
```

- The *logical NOT* operator has higher precedence than the *greater than* operator, the expression `! x > y` actually evaluates as `(!x) > y`. 
- Since *x* is 5, !x evaluates to *0*, and `0 > y` is false, so the *else* statement executes.

- If *logical NOT* is intended to operate on the result of other operators, the other operators and their operands need to be **enclosed in parentheses**.

- Simple uses of *logical NOT*, such as `if (!value)` do not need parentheses because precedence does not come into play.

## Logical OR

- The ***logical OR*** operator is used to test **whether either of two conditions is true**. 
- If the left operand evaluates to true, or the right operand evaluates to true, or both are true, then the *logical OR* operator returns true. Otherwise it will return false.

| Left operand | Right operand | Result |
| :----------- | :------------ | :----- |
| false        | false         | false  |
| false        | true          | true   |
| true         | false         | true   |
| true         | true          | true   |

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    int value {};
    std::cin >> value;

    if (value == 0 || value == 1)
        std::cout << "You picked 0 or 1\n";
    else
        std::cout << "You did not pick 0 or 1\n";
    return 0;
}
```

- In this case, we use the logical OR operator to test whether either the left condition (value == 0) or the right condition (value == 1) is true. 
- If either (or both) are true, the *logical OR* operator evaluates to true, which means the *if statement* executes.
- If neither are true, the *logical OR* operator evaluates to false, which means the *else statement* executes.

You can string together many *logical OR* statements:

```cpp
if (value == 0 || value == 1 || value == 2 || value == 3)
     std::cout << "You picked 0, 1, 2, or 3\n";
```

## Logical AND

- The ***logical AND*** operator is used to **test whether both operands are true**. If both operands are true, *logical AND* returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

| Left operand | Right operand | Result |
| :----------- | :------------ | :----- |
| false        | false         | false  |
| false        | true          | false  |
| true         | false         | false  |
| true         | true          | true   |

For example, we might want to know if the value of variable *x* is between *10* and *20*. This is actually two conditions: we need to know if *x* is greater than *10*, and also whether *x* is less than *20*.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    int value {};
    std::cin >> value;

    if (value > 10 && value < 20)
        std::cout << "Your value is between 10 and 20\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Your value is not between 10 and 20\n";
    return 0;
}
```

As with *logical OR*, you can string together many *logical AND* statements:

```cpp
if (value > 10 && value < 20 && value != 16)
    // do something
else
    // do something else
```

- If all of these conditions are true, the *if statement* will execute. If any of these conditions are false, the *else statement* will execute.

- As with logical and bitwise OR, new programmers sometimes confuse the *logical AND* operator (&&) with the *bitwise AND* operator (&).

## Short circuit evaluation

- If the first operand evaluates to false, the *logical AND* operator will go ahead and return false immediately without even evaluating the second operand.
- This is known as **short circuit evaluation**, and it is done primarily for optimization purposes.

- Similarly, if the first operand for *logical OR* is true, then the entire OR condition has to evaluate to true, and the second operand won’t be evaluated.

- Short circuit evaluation presents another opportunity to show why operators that cause side effects should not be used in compound expressions.

  - ```cpp
    if (x == 1 && ++y == 2)
        // do something
    ```

    if *x* does not equal *1*, the whole condition must be false, so ++y never gets evaluated! Thus, *y* will only be incremented if *x* evaluates to 1, which is probably not what the programmer intended!

- Short circuit evaluation may cause *Logical OR* and *Logical AND* to not evaluate one operand. Avoid using expressions with side effects in conjunction with these operators.

Key insight

The Logical OR and logical AND operators are an exception to the rule that the operands may evaluate in any order, as the standard explicitly states that the left operand must evaluate first.

- When mixing *logical AND* and *logical OR* in a single expression, explicitly p**arenthesize each operation** to ensure they evaluate how you intend.

De Morgan’s law

Many programmers also make the mistake of thinking that `!(x && y)` is the same thing as `!x && !y`. Unfortunately, you can not “distribute” the *logical NOT* in that manner.s

```
!(x && y)` is equivalent to `!x || !y`
`!(x || y)` is equivalent to `!x && !y
```

In other words, when you distribute the *logical NOT*, you also need to flip *logical AND* to *logical OR*, and vice-versa!

This can sometimes be useful when trying to make complex expressions easier to read.

For advanced readers

We can show that the first part of De Morgan’s Law is correct by proving that `!(x && y)` equals `!x || !y` for every possible value of `x` and `y`. To do so, we’ll use a mathematical concept called a truth table:



| x     | y     | !x    | !y    | !(x && y) | !x \|\| !y |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :-------- | :--------- |
| false | false | true  | true  | true      | true       |
| false | true  | true  | false | true      | true       |
| true  | false | false | true  | true      | true       |
| true  | true  | false | false | false     | false      |

In this table, the first and second columns represent our `x` and `y` variables. Each row in the table shows one permutation of possible values for `x` and `y`. Because `x` and `y` are Boolean values, we only need 4 rows to cover every combination of possible values that `x` and `y` can hold.

The rest of the columns in the table represent expressions that we want to evaluate based on the initial values of `x` and `y`. The third and fourth columns calculate the values of `!x` and `!y` respectively. The fifth column calculates the value of `!(x && y)`. Finally, the sixth column calculates the value of `!x || !y`.

You’ll notice for each row, the value in the fifth column matches the value in the sixth column. This means for every possible value of `x` and `y`, the value of `!(x && y)` equals `!x || !y`, which is what we were trying to prove!

We can do the same for the second part of De Morgan’s Law:



| x     | y     | !x    | !y    | !(x \|\| y) | !x && !y |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---------- | :------- |
| false | false | true  | true  | true        | true     |
| false | true  | true  | false | false       | false    |
| true  | false | false | true  | false       | false    |
| true  | true  | false | false | false       | false    |

Similarly, for every possible value of `x` and `y`, we can see that the value of `!(x || y)` equals the value of `!x && !y`. Thus, they are equivalent.

Where’s the logical exclusive or (XOR) operator?

*Logical XOR* is a logical operator provided in some languages that is used to test whether an odd number of conditions is true.



| Left operand | Right operand | Result |
| :----------- | :------------ | :----- |
| false        | false         | false  |
| false        | true          | true   |
| true         | false         | true   |
| true         | true          | false  |

C++ doesn’t provide a *logical XOR* operator. Unlike *logical OR* or *logical AND*, *logical XOR* cannot be short circuit evaluated. Because of this, making a *logical XOR* operator out of *logical OR* and *logical AND* operators is challenging. However, you can easily mimic *logical XOR* using the *inequality* operator (!=):

```cpp
if (a != b) ... // a XOR b, assuming a and b are Booleans
```

This can be extended to multiple operands as follows:

```cpp
if (a != b != c != d) ... // a XOR b XOR c XOR d, assuming a, b, c, and d are Booleans
```

COPY

Note that the above XOR patterns only work if the operands are Booleans (not integers). If you need a form of *logical XOR* that works with non-Boolean operands, you can static_cast them to bool:

```cpp
if (static_cast<bool>(a) != static_cast<bool>(b) != static_cast<bool>(c) != static_cast<bool>(d)) ... // a XOR b XOR c XOR d, for any type that can be converted to bool
```

## Alternative operator representations

| Operator name | Keyword alternate name |
| :------------ | :--------------------- |
| &&            | and                    |
| \|\|          | or                     |
| !             | not                    |

This means the following are identical:

```cpp
std::cout << !a && (b || c);
std::cout << not a and (b or c);
```

- C++ developers prefer using the symbolic names over the keyword names. 
- You will commonly find the symbolic names in existing code.

Question #1

Evaluate the following expressions.

Note: in the following answers, we “explain our work” by showing you the steps taken to get to the final answer. The steps are separated by a *=>* symbol. Expressions that were ignored due to the short circuit rules are placed in square brackets. For example
(1 < 2 || 3 != 3) =>
(true || [3 != 3]) =>
(true) =>
true
means we evaluated (1 < 2 || 3 != 3) to arrive at (true || [3 != 3]) and evaluated that to arrive at “true”. The 3 != 3 was never executed due to short circuiting.
