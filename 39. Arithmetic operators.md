# 5.2 — Arithmetic operators

## Unary arithmetic operators

- There are **two unary arithmetic operators,** plus (+), and minus (-). \
- As a reminder, unary operators are operators that **only take one operand**.

| Operator    | Symbol | Form | Operation     |
| :---------- | :----- | :--- | :------------ |
| Unary plus  | +      | +x   | Value of x    |
| Unary minus | -      | -x   | Negation of x |

- The **unary minus** operator **returns the operand multiplied by -1**.

- The **unary plus** operator returns the value of the operand. Generally you won’t need to use this operator since it’s redundant. It was added largely to **provide symmetry with the *unary minus* operator**.

- For best effect, both of these **operators should be placed immediately preceding the operand** (e.g. **`-x`, not `- x`**).

- In the expression `x = 5 - -3;`, the first minus is the ***binary subtraction* operator**, and the second is the ***unary minus* operator**.

## Binary arithmetic operators

- There are **5 binary arithmetic operators**. 
- **Binary operators** are operators that **take a left and right operand**.

| Operator            | Symbol | Form  | Operation                       |
| :------------------ | :----- | :---- | :------------------------------ |
| Addition            | +      | x + y | x plus y                        |
| Subtraction         | -      | x - y | x minus y                       |
| Multiplication      | *      | x * y | x multiplied by y               |
| Division            | /      | x / y | x divided by y                  |
| Modulus (Remainder) | %      | x % y | The remainder of x divided by y |

## Integer and floating point division

- If **either (or both) of the operands are floating point values**, the *division operator* performs floating point division. 
  - **Floating point division** returns a floating point value, and the **fraction is kept.** 
  - For example, `7.0 / 4 = 1.75`, `7 / 4.0 = 1.75`, and `7.0 / 4.0 = 1.75`. 
  - As with all floating point arithmetic operations, **rounding errors may occur**.

- If **both of the operands are integers**, the *division operator* performs integer division instead. 
  - **Integer division** **drops any fractions and returns an integer value**. 
  - For example, `7 / 4 = 1` because the fractional portion of the result is dropped.
  - Similarly, `-7 / 4 = -1` because the fraction is dropped.

### Using static_cast to do floating point division with integers

- We can **use *static_cast<>* to convert an integer to a floating point number so that we can do *floating point division* instead of *integer division***.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      int x{ 7 };
      int y{ 4 };
  
      std::cout << "int / int = " << x / y << '\n';
      std::cout << "double / int = " << static_cast<double>(x) / y << '\n';
      std::cout << "int / double = " << x / static_cast<double>(y) << '\n';
      std::cout << "double / double = " << static_cast<double>(x) / static_cast<double>(y) << '\n';
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  ```
  int / int = 1
  double / int = 1.75
  int / double = 1.75
  double / double = 1.75
  ```

- The above illustrates that **if either operand is a floating point number, the result will be floating point division, not integer division**.

## Dividing by zero

- Trying to **divide by 0 (or 0.0) will generally cause your program to crash**, as the **results are mathematically undefined**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
  	std::cout << "Enter a divisor: ";
  	int x{};
  	std::cin >> x;
  
  	std::cout << "12 / " << x << " = " << 12 / x << '\n';
  
  	return 0;
  }
  ```

- If you run the above program and enter 0, your program will either crash or terminate abnormally.

## Arithmetic assignment operators

| Operator                  | Symbol | Form   | Operation                       |
| :------------------------ | :----- | :----- | :------------------------------ |
| Assignment                | =      | x = y  | Assign value y to x             |
| Addition assignment       | +=     | x += y | Add y to x                      |
| Subtraction assignment    | -=     | x -= y | Subtract y from x               |
| Multiplication assignment | *=     | x *= y | Multiply x by y                 |
| Division assignment       | /=     | x /= y | Divide x by y                   |
| Modulus assignment        | %=     | x %= y | Put the remainder of x / y in x |



```cpp
x = x + 4; // add 4 to existing value of x
```

- It takes two operators to execute (operator+, and operator=).

- C++ provides **five arithmetic assignment operators** for convenience. 
  - Instead of writing `x = x + 4`, you can write `x += 4`. 
  - Instead of `x = x * y`, you can write `x *= y`.

- Thus, the above becomes:

  ```cpp
  x += 4; // add 4 to existing value of x
  ```
