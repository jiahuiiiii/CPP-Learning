# 0.7 — Compiling your first program

## Projects

- To **write a C++ program inside an IDE**, we typically start by **creating a new project**. 
- A **project** is a **container** that holds all of your source code files, images, data files, etc… that are needed to produce an executable (or library, website, etc…) that you can run or use. 
- The project also **saves various IDE, compiler, and linker settings**, as well as remembering where you left off, so that when you reopen the project later, the state of the IDE can be restored to wherever you left off. 
- When you choose to **compile your program**, all of **the .cpp files in the project will get compiled and linked**.
- Each **project corresponds to one program**.
- When you’re ready to create a second program, you’ll either need to **create a new project**, or **overwrite the code in an existing project**. 
- **Project files are generally IDE specific** (ex. .vscode file), so a project created for one IDE will need to be recreated in a different IDE.

### Console projects

- When you create a new project, you’ll generally be asked what type of project you want to create. 
- A **console project** means that we are going to create programs that can be run from the Windows, Linux, or Mac console.

- By default, **console applications** have **no graphical user interface (GUI)**, they **print text to the console**, **read input from the keyboard**, and are **compiled into stand-alone executable files**. 
- This is perfect for learning C++, because it **keeps the complexity to a minimum**, and ensures things work on a wide variety of systems. 
- We’ll **compile and launch our programs through our IDEs** (which will invoke the console when necessary).

## Workspaces / solutions

- When you create a **new project** for your program, many **IDEs will automatically add your project to a “workspace” or a “solution”** (the term varies by IDE).
- A workspace or solution is a c**ontainer that can hold one or more related projects**. 
  - For example, if you were writing a game and wanted to have a separate executable for single player and multiplayer, you’d need to create two projects. It wouldn’t make sense for both of these projects to be completely independent -- after all, they are part of the same game. Mostly likely, each would be configured as a separate project within a single workspace/solution.

## Writing your first program

After you have setup your c++ environment, let's start coding.

Traditionally, the first program programmers write in a new language is the infamous [hello world program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world)

1. In the text editor (ex. Visual Studio Code), create a file and name it `HelloWorld.cpp`. 
2. Type/copy the following into your IDE

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, world!";
	return 0;
}
```

3. Ctrl + Shift + B to build

4. sucessfully built

5. Run the executable that has been built in the last step. tada~~

## Warning and Error

### Error 

- When you write your programs, the **compiler** will check to **ensure you’ve followed the rules** of the C++ language

- The compiler will **emit an error during compilation** if you have done something that definitively **violates the rules of the language**, providing both line number containing the error, and some text about what was expected vs what was found. 
- The actual error may be on that line, or on a preceding line. 
- Once you**’ve identified and fixed** the erroneous line(s) of code, you can **try compiling again**.

### Warning

- The compiler will issue a **warning **if it find code that seems like it might be in error, but the compiler can’t be sure. 
- **Warnings do not halt compilation** but you should resolve them as you encounter them.
- In most cases, warnings can be resolved either by **fixing the error the warning is pointing out**, or by **rewriting the line of code generating the warning** in such a way that the warning is no longer generated.
