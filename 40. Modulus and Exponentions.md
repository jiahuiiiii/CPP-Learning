# 5.3 — Modulus and Exponentiation

## The modulus operator

- The **modulus operator** (a.k.a. *remainder operator*) is an operator that **returns the remainder after doing an integer division**. 
- Modulus only works with **integer operands**.

- Modulus is **most useful for testing whether a number is evenly divisible by another number**

  - if ***x % y* evaluates to 0**, then we know that ***x* is evenly divisible by *y***.

  - Now let’s try an example where the second number is bigger than the first:

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
  	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
  	int x{};
  	std::cin >> x;
  
  	std::cout << "Enter another integer: ";
  	int y{};
  	std::cin >> y;
  
  	std::cout << "The remainder is: " << x % y << '\n';
  
  	if ((x % y) == 0)
  		std::cout << x << " is evenly divisible by " << y << '\n';
  	else
  		std::cout << x << " is not evenly divisible by " << y << '\n';
  
  	return 0;
  }
  ```
  
  ```
  Enter an integer: 6
  Enter another integer: 3
  The remainder is: 0
  6 is evenly divisible by 3
  Enter an integer: 6
  Enter another integer: 4
  The remainder is: 2
  6 is not evenly divisible by 4
  ```
  - Now let’s try an example where the second number is bigger than the first:
  ```
  Enter an integer: 2
  Enter another integer: 4
  The remainder is: 2
  2 is not evenly divisible by 4
  ```
  
  - A remainder of 2 might be a little non-obvious at first, but it’s simple: 2 / 4 is 0 (using integer division) remainder 2. Whenever the second number is larger than the first, the second number will divide the first 0 times, so the first number will be the remainder.

## Modulus with negative numbers

- The **modulus operator** can also work with **negative operands**. 
- **`x % y` always returns results with the *sign of x*.**

```
Enter an integer: -6
Enter another integer: 4
The remainder is: -2
-6 is not evenly divisible by 4
Enter an integer: 6
Enter another integer: -4
The remainder is: 2
6 is not evenly divisible by -4
```

- In both cases, you can see the **remainder takes the sign of the first operand**.

## Exponent Operator

-  C++ does not include an exponent operator.

- To do **exponents** in C++, **#include the <cmath> header, and use the pow() function**:

  ```cpp
  #include <cmath>
  
  double x{ std::pow(3.0, 4.0) }; // 3 to the 4th power
  ```

- Note that the **parameters (and return value) of function pow() are of type double**. 
- Due to **rounding errors in floating point numbers**, the **results of pow() may not be precise**.

- The following function implements integer exponentiation (using the non-intuitive “exponentiation by squaring” algorithm for efficiency):

  ```cpp
  #include <cstdint> // for std::int_fast64_t
  
  // note: exp must be non-negative
  std::int_fast64_t pow(int base, int exp)
  {
      std::int_fast64_t result{ 1 };
      while (exp)
      {
          if (exp & 1)
              result *= base;
          exp >>= 1;
          base *= base;
      }
  
      return result;
  }
  ```

  ```

  ```

- In the vast majority of cases, **integer exponentiation will overflow the integral type**.
- This is likely why such a function wasn’t included in the standard library in the first place.
