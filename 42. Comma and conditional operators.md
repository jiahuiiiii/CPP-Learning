# 5.5 — Comma and conditional operators

## The comma operator

| Operator | Symbol | Form | Operation                             |
| :------- | :----- | :--- | :------------------------------------ |
| Comma    | ,      | x, y | Evaluate x then y, returns value of y |

- The **comma operator (,)** allows you to **evaluate multiple expressions wherever a single expression is allowed**. 
- The comma operator **evaluates the left operand, then the right operand**, and then **returns the result of the right operand**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 1 };
    int y{ 2 };

    std::cout << (++x, ++y); // increment x and y, evaluates to the right operand

    return 0;
}
```

- First the left operand of the comma operator is evaluated, which increments *x* from *1* to *2*. 
- The right operand is evaluated, which increments *y* from *2* to *3*. The comma operator returns the result of the right operand (*3*), which is subsequently printed to the console.

- Note that **comma** has the **lowest precedence of all the operators**, even **lower than assignment**. 

- In almost every case, **a statement written using the comma operator** would be better written as **separate statements**. 

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      int x{ 1 };
      int y{ 2 };
  
      ++x;
      std::cout << ++y;
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- Avoid using the comma operator, except within ***for loops***.

## Comma as a separator

- In C++, the comma symbol is often used as a separator, and these uses do not invoke the comma operator.

  ```cpp
  void foo(int x, int y) // Comma used to separate parameters in function definition
  {
      add(x, y); // Comma used to separate arguments in function call
      constexpr int z{ 3 }, w{ 5 }; // Comma used to separate multiple variables being defined on the same line (don't do this)
  }
  ```

  

## The conditional operator

| Operator    | Symbol | Form      | Operation                                                    |
| :---------- | :----- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conditional | ? :    | c ? x : y | If c is nonzero (true) then evaluate x, otherwise evaluate y |

- The **conditional operator (?:)** (a.k.a. the “arithmetic if” operator) is a **ternary operator** (it takes **3 operands**). 
- Because it has historically been **C++’s only ternary operator**, it’s also sometimes referred to as “**the ternary operator**”.

- The ?: operator provides a **shorthand method for doing a particular type of if/else statement**. 

- An if/else statement takes the following form:

  ```cpp
  if (condition)
      statement1;
  else
      statement2;
  ```

- The ?: operator takes the following form:

  ```cpp
  (condition) ? expression1 : expression2;
  ```

- If ***condition*** evaluates to ***true***, then ***expression1*** is executed, **otherwise *expression2*** is executed. Note that ***expression2* is not optional**.

------

```cpp
if (x > y)
    larger = x;
else
    larger = y;
```

```cpp
larger = (x > y) ? x : y;
```

## Parenthesization of the conditional operator

It is common convention to put the conditional part of the operation inside of parentheses, both to make it easier to read, and also to make sure the precedence is correct. The other operands evaluate as if they were parenthesized, so explicit parenthesization is not required for those.

Note that the ?: operator has a very low precedence. If doing anything other than assigning the result to a variable, the whole ?: operator also needs to be wrapped in parentheses.

For example, to print the larger of values x and y to the screen, we could do this:

```cpp
if (x > y)
    std::cout << x;
else
    std::cout << y;
```

COPY

Or we could use the conditional operator to do this:

```cpp
std::cout << ((x > y) ? x : y);
```

COPY

Let’s examine what happens if we don’t parenthesize the whole conditional operator in the above case.

Because the << operator has higher precedence than the ?: operator, the statement:

```cpp
std::cout << (x > y) ? x : y;
```

COPY

would evaluate as:

```cpp
(std::cout << (x > y)) ? x : y;
```

COPY

That would print 1 (true) if x > y, or 0 (false) otherwise!

Best practice

Always parenthesize the conditional part of the conditional operator, and consider parenthesizing the whole thing as well.

The conditional operator evaluates as an expression

Because the conditional operator operands are expressions rather than statements, the conditional operator can be used in some places where if/else can not.

For example, when initializing a constant variable:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    constexpr bool inBigClassroom { false };
    constexpr int classSize { inBigClassroom ? 30 : 20 };
    std::cout << "The class size is: " << classSize << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

There’s no satisfactory if/else statement for this. You might think to try something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    constexpr bool inBigClassroom { false };

    if (inBigClassroom)
        constexpr int classSize { 30 };
    else
        constexpr int classSize { 20 };

    std::cout << "The class size is: " << classSize;

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

However, this won’t compile, and you’ll get an error message that classSize isn’t defined. Much like how variables defined inside functions die at the end of the function, variables defined inside an if or else statement die at the end of the if or else statement. Thus, classSize has already been destroyed by the time we try to print it.

If you want to use an if/else, you’d have to do something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int getClassSize(bool inBigClassroom)
{
    if (inBigClassroom)
        return 30;

    return 20;
}

int main()
{
    const int classSize { getClassSize(false) };
    std::cout << "The class size is: " << classSize;

    return 0;
}
```

COPY

This one works because we’re not defining variables inside the *if* or *else*, we’re just returning a value back to the caller, which can then be used as the initializer.

That’s a lot of extra work!

The type of the expressions must match or be convertible

To properly comply with C++’s type checking, either the type of both expressions in a conditional statement must match, or the both expressions must be convertible to a common type.

For advanced readers

The conversion rules used when the types don’t match are rather complicated. You can find them [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_other).

So while you might expect to be able to do something like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	constexpr int x{ 5 };
	std::cout << (x != 5 ? x : "x is 5"); // won't compile

	return 0;
}
```

COPY

The above example won’t compile. One of the expressions is an integer, and the other is a string literal. The compiler is unable to determine a common type for expressions of these types. In such cases, you’ll have to use an if/else.

So when should you use the conditional operator?

The conditional operator gives us a convenient way to compact some if/else statements. It’s most useful when we need a conditional initializer (or assignment) for a variable, or to pass a conditional value to a function.

It should not be used for complex if/else statements, as it quickly becomes both unreadable and error prone.

Best practice

Only use the conditional operator for simple conditionals where you use the result and where it enhances readability.
