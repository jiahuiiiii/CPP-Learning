# 2.2 — Function return values

Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	// get a value from the user
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int num{};
	std::cin >> num;

	// print the value doubled
	std::cout << num << " doubled is: " << num * 2 << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

- First, we **get a value from the user**. Then we **tell the user what double that value is.**

-  We can break it into multiple function.s

```cpp
// This program doesn't work
#include <iostream>

void getValueFromUser()
{
 	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int input{};
	std::cin >> input;
}

int main()
{
	getValueFromUser(); // Ask user for input

	int num{}; // How do we get the value from getValueFromUser() and use it to initialize this variable?

	std::cout << num << " doubled is: " << num * 2 << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

- When function *getValueFromUser* is called, the user is asked to enter an integer as expected. But the **value they enter is lost when *getValueFromUser* terminates and control returns to *main***. Variable ***num* never gets initialized with the value the user entered**, and so **the program always prints the answer 0**.
- We’re missing some way for *getValueFromUser* to **return the value the user entered back to *main* so that *main* can make use of that data**.

## Return values

- When you write a user-defined function, you get to **determine whether your function will return a value back to the caller or not**. 
- To return a value back to the caller, two things are needed.
  - First, your function has to indicate **return type**, which is **the type that is defined before the function’s name**. Note that this **doesn’t determine what specific value is returned** -- only the **type of the value**.
  - Second, inside **the function that will return a value**, we use a **return statement** to **indicate the specific value being returned to the caller**. The specific value returned from a function is called the **return value**. When the **return statement is executed**, the **return value is copied from the function back to the caller**. This process is called **return by value**.

Let’s take a look at a simple function that returns an integer value, and a sample program that calls it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// int is the return type
// A return type of int means the function will return some integer value to the caller (the specific value is not specified here)
int returnFive()
{
    // the return statement indicates the specific value that will be returned
    return 5; // return the specific value 5 back to the caller
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << returnFive() << '\n'; // prints 5
    std::cout << returnFive() + 2 << '\n'; // prints 7

    returnFive(); // okay: the value 5 is returned, but is ignored since main() doesn't do anything with it

    return 0;
}
```

```
5
7
```

- **Execution starts at the top of main**. 
- In the first statement, the **function call to *returnFive* is evaluated**, which results in **function *returnFive* being called.** 
- Function ***returnFive* returns the specific value of 5 back to the caller**, which is then printed to the console via **std::cout**.
- In the second function call, the function call to *returnFive* is evaluated again, which results in **function *returnFive* returns the value of 5 back to the caller**. The **expression 5 + 2 is evaluated to produce the result 7**, which is then printed to the console via **std::cout.**
- In the third statement, function *returnFive* is called again, resulting in the **value 5 being returned back to the caller**. However, **function *main* does nothing with the return value**, so nothing further happens (the **return value is ignored**).

> Return values will not be printed unless the caller sends them to the console via std::cout. In the last case above, the return value is not sent to std::cout, so nothing is printed.
>
> When a called function returns a value, the caller may decide to use that value (e.g. by assigning it to a variable, or sending it to std::cout) or ignore it (by doing nothing else).

## Fixing our challenge program

With this in mind, we can fix the program we presented at the top of the lesson:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int getValueFromUser() // this function now returns an integer value
{
 	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int input{};
	std::cin >> input;

	return input; // return the value the user entered back to the caller
}

int main()
{
	int num { getValueFromUser() }; // initialize num with the return value of getValueFromUser()

	std::cout << num << " doubled is: " << num * 2 << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

- The first statement in *main* will c**reate an int variable named *num***. When the program goes to initialize *num*, it will see that there is a **function call to *getValueFromUser***, so it will go execute that function. 
- Function *getValueFromUser*, **asks the user to enter a value**, and then it **returns that value back to the caller (*main*)**. This **return value is used as the initialization value for variable *num***.

## Void return values

- **Functions are not required to return a value**. 
- To **tell the compiler that a function does not return a value**, a **return type of void** is used. 

```cpp
void doPrint() // void is the return type
{
    std::cout << "In doPrint()" << '\n';
    // This function does not return a value so no return statement is needed
}
```

- This function **has a return type of void, indicating that it does not return a value to the caller**. Because **it does not return a value, no return statement is needed** (trying to **return a specific value** from a function with a **void return type** will result in a **compilation error**).

Here’s another example of a function that returns void, and a sample program that calls it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// void means the function does not return a value to the caller
void returnNothing()
{
    std::cout << "Hi" << '\n';
    // This function does not return a value so no return statement is needed
}

int main()
{
    returnNothing(); // okay: function returnNothing() is called, no value is returned

    std::cout << returnNothing(); // error: this line will not compile.  You'll need to comment it out to continue.

    return 0;
}
```

- The **function call to function *returnNothing* won’t even compile**.
- Function *returnNothing* **has a void return type**, meaning it doesn’t return a value. 
- However, **this statement is trying to send the return value of *returnNothing* to std::cout to be printed**.
- The **compiler will flag this as an error.** You’ll need to **comment out this line of code in order to make your code compile**.

- A **void return type** is used when we want to **have a function that doesn’t return anything to the caller**. In the above example, the *returnNothing* function has useful behavior (it prints “Hi”) but it doesn’t need to return anything back to the caller (in this case, *main*). Therefore, *returnNothing* is given a void return type.

- When we **call a function in a context** that **requires a value (e.g. std::cout)**, we **must provide a value. In such a context**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function that does not return a value
void returnNothing()
{
}

// Function that returns a value
int returnFive()
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    // When calling a function by itself, no value is required
    returnNothing(); // ok: we can call a function that does not return a value
    returnFive();    // ok: we can call a function that returns a value, and ignore that return value

    // When calling a function in a context that requires a value (like std::cout)
    std::cout << returnFive();    // ok: we can call a function that returns a value, and the value will be used
    std::cout << returnNothing(); // error: we can't call a function that does not return a value

    return 0;
}
```

## Returning to main

- When the **program is executed**, the **operating system makes a function call to *main***. 
- **Execution then jumps to the top of *main***. 
- The **statements in *main* are executed sequentially**. Finally, ***main* returns an integer value (usually 0)**, and your **program terminates**. 
- The **return value from `main`** is sometimes called a **status code** (a.k.a. **exit code** a.k.a. **return code**), as it is **used to indicate whether the program ran successfully or not**.

- A **status code of 0** means the **program executed successfully**.

> Your *main* function should return 0 if the program ran normally.

- A **non-zero status code** is often used to **indicate failure**.

## C++ Status Code

- The C++ standard only defines the meaning of **3 status codes**: 
  - **0**, E**XIT_SUCCESS**, and **EXIT_FAILURE**. 
  - **0 and EXIT_SUCCESS** both mean **the program executed successfully**. **EXIT_FAILURE** means the **program did not execute successfully**.

- **EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE** are defined in the **<cstdlib> header**:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // for EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE

int main()
{
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

- If you want to **maximize portability**, you should only **use 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS to indicate a successful termination**, or **EXIT_FAILURE to indicate an unsuccessful termination**.

- **C++ disallows calling the *main* function explicitly**.

- You should **define your *main* function at the bottom of your code file**, below other functions.

## Return values

- If a function has a **non-void return type**, it *must* **return a value of that type**. 
- Failure to do so will result in **undefined behavior**. 
- The only **exception** to this rule is for **function main()**, which will **assume a return value of 0 if one is not explicitly provided**. 

> Always explicitly provide a return value for any function that has a non-void return type.

- When a **return statement is executed**, the **function returns back to the caller immediately** at that point. Any additional **code after the return statement in the function is ignored**.

- A **function can only return a single value back to the caller each time it is called**. However, the value **doesn’t need to be a literal**, it can be the result of any **valid expression**, including a variable or even a **call to another function that returns a value**. 

- It’s a good idea to **document your function with a comment indicating what the return values mean**.

For example:

```cpp
// Function asks user to enter a value
// Return value is the integer entered by the user from the keyboard
int getValueFromUser()
{
 	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int input{};
	std::cin >> input;

	return input; // return the value the user entered back to the caller
}
```

## Reusing functions

Now we can illustrate a good case for function reuse. Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	int x{};
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	std::cin >> x;

	int y{};
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	std::cin >> y;

	std::cout << x << " + " << y << " = " << x + y << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

- This program violates one of the central tenets原则 of **good programming: “Don’t Repeat Yourself”** (often **abbreviated “DRY”**).

- If we wanted to **change the text “Enter an integer:” to something else**, we’d **have to update it in two locations**. 
- That would be **a lot of redundant code多余** (making our programs **longer and harder to understand**), and a lot of room for **typos** to creep in.

Let’s update this program to use our *getValueFromUser* function that we developed above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int getValueFromUser()
{
 	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int input{};
	std::cin >> input;

	return input;
}

int main()
{
    int x{ getValueFromUser() }; // first call to getValueFromUser
    int y{ getValueFromUser() }; // second call to getValueFromUser

    std::cout << x << " + " << y << " = " << x + y << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
Enter an integer: 5
Enter an integer: 7
5 + 7 = 12
```

- In this program, we **call *getValueFromUser* twice**, once to initialize variable *x*, and once to initialize variable *y*. 
- That **saves us from duplicating the code to get user input, and reduces the odds of making a mistake**. 
- Once we know ***getValueFromUser* works for one variable**, it wil**l work for as many of them as we need**.

- This is the **essence实质 of modular programming**: 
  - the ability to **write a function, test it, ensure that it works, and then know that we can reuse it as many times as we want**

- If you **need to do something more than once, consider how to modify your code to remove as much redundancy累赘 as possible**. 
- **Variables** can be used to store the **results of calculations that need to be used more than once** (so we **don’t have to repeat the calculation**). 
- **Functions** can be used to **define a sequence of statements we want to execute more than once**. 
- **Loops** can be **used to execute a statement more than once**.

## Conclusion

- **Return values** provide a way for functions to **return a single value back to the function’s caller**.

- **Functions** provide a way to **minimize redundancy in our programs**.
