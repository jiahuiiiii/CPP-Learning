# 5.4 — Increment/decrement operators, and side effects

## Incrementing and decrementing variables

- **Incrementing (adding 1 to)** and **decrementing (subtracting 1 from)** a variable are both so common that they have their own operators.

| Operator                           | Symbol | Form | Operation                                      |
| :--------------------------------- | :----- | :--- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Prefix increment (pre-increment)   | ++     | ++x  | Increment x, then return x                     |
| Prefix decrement (pre-decrement)   | ––     | ––x  | Decrement x, then return x                     |
| Postfix increment (post-increment) | ++     | x++  | Copy x, then increment x, then return the copy |
| Postfix decrement (post-decrement) | ––     | x––  | Copy x, then decrement x, then return the copy |

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int y = ++x; // x is incremented to 6, x is evaluated to the value 6, and 6 is assigned to y

    std::cout << x << ' ' << y;
    return 0;
}
```

```
6 6
```

- The **postfix increment/decrement operators** are trickier. 
- First, **a copy of the operand is made**. Then t**he operand (not the copy) is incremented or decremented**. Finally, **the copy (not the original) is evaluated**. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x { 5 };
    int y = x++; // x is incremented to 6, copy of original x is evaluated to the value 5, and 5 is assigned to y

    std::cout << x << ' ' << y;
    return 0;
}
```

```
6 5
```

- *y* ends up with the value of *5* (the pre-incremented value), and *x* ends up with the value *6* (the post-incremented value).

------



```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int y{ 5 };
    std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n';
    std::cout << ++x << ' ' << --y << '\n'; // prefix
    std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n';
    std::cout << x++ << ' ' << y-- << '\n'; // postfix
    std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
5 5
6 4
6 4
6 4
7 3
```

- Strongly **favor the prefix version of the increment and decrement operators**, as they are generally more performant, and you’re less likely to run into strange issues with them.

## Side effects

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int value{ add(x, ++x) }; // is this 5 + 6, or 6 + 6?
    // It depends on what order your compiler evaluates the function arguments in

    std::cout << value << '\n'; // value could be 11 or 12, depending on how the above line evaluates!
    return 0;
}
```

- **C++ does not define the order of evaluation for function arguments or operator operands.**
  - If the left argument is evaluated first, this becomes a call to add(5, 6), which equals 11. 
  - If the right argument is evaluated first, this becomes a call to add(6, 6), which equals 12.
  - Note that this is only a problem because one of the arguments to function add() has a side effect.

- The C++ standard intentionally does not define these things so that compilers can do whatever is most natural for a given architecture.

- There are other cases where the C++ standard does not specify the order in which certain things are evaluated (such as operator operands), so different compilers may exhibit different behaviors. 
- These problems can generally *all* be avoided by ensuring that any variable that has a side-effect applied is used no more than once in a given statement.

> Don’t use a variable that has a side effect applied to it more than once in a given statement. If you do, the result may be undefined.
