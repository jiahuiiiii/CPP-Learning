# 4.4 — Signed integers

- An **integer** is an integral type that can represent **positive and negative whole numbers**, **including 0** (e.g. -2, -1, 0, 1, 2).
- C++ has ***4* different fundamental integer types** available for use:
- | Type      | Minimum Size | Note                                      |
| :-------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| short     | 16 bits      |                                           |
| int       | 16 bits      | Typically 32 bits on modern architectures |
| long      | 32 bits      |                                           |
| long long | 64 bits      |                                           |

- The key difference between the various integer types is that they have varying sizes -- **the larger integers can hold bigger numbers.**

- C++ only guarantees that integers will have a certain **minimum size**, not that they will have a **specific size**. 

## Signed integers

- This attribute of being **positive, negative, or zero** is called the number’s **sign**.

- By default, integers are **signed**, which means the **number’s sign is stored as part of the number** (using a single bit called the **sign bit**). 
- Therefore, a **signed integer can hold both positive and negative numbers (and 0)**.

## Defining signed integers

```cpp
short s;
int i;
long l;
long long ll;
```

- All of the **integers (except int) can take an optional *int* suffix**.

```cpp
short int si;
long int li;
long long int lli;
```

- The integer types can also take an optional ***signed* keyword**.

```cpp
signed short ss;
signed int si;
signed long sl;
signed long long sll;
```

- Prefer the shorthand types that **do not use the *int* suffix or signed prefix**.

## Signed integer ranges

- A **variable with *n* bits** can **hold 2^n^ possible values.** 
- We call **the set of specific values that a data type can hold** its **range**. 
- The **range of an integer variable** is determined by two factors: **its size** (in bits), and whether it is **signed or not**.

- By definition, **an 8-bit signed integer has a range of -128 to 127.**

- Math time: an **8-bit integer contains 8 bits**. 2^8^ is 256, so an **8-bit integer can hold 256 possible values**. There are **256 possible values between -128 to 127**, inclusive.

| Size/Type     | Range                                                   |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8 bit signed  | -128 to 127                                             |
| 16 bit signed | -32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| 32 bit signed | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| 64 bit signed | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

- An n-bit signed variable has a range of -(2^n^-1) to 2^n^-1-1.

## Integer overflow

- **Integer overflow** (*overflow*) occurs when we **try to store a value that is outside the range of the type**. 
- The **number we are trying to store requires more bits to represent than the object has available**. 
- In such a case, **data is lost because the object doesn’t have enough memory to store everything.**

- **Signed integer overflow** leads to **undefined behavior**.

## Integer division

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << 20 / 4;
    return 0;
}
```

```
5
```

Let’s look at what happens when integer division causes a fractional result:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << 8 / 5;
    return 0;
}
```

This produces a possibly unexpected result:

```
1
```

- When doing **division with two integers** (called **integer division**), C++ always **produces an integer result**. 
- Since **integers can’t hold fractional values**, any **fractional portion is simply dropped** (**not rounded**!).

- **-8 / 5** results in the value **-1**.

- Be careful when using **integer division**, as you will **lose any fractional parts of the quotient**.
