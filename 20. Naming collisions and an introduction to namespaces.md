# 2.8 — Naming collisions and an introduction to namespaces

- C++ requires that all **identifiers** be **non-ambiguous**. 
- If **two identical identifiers** are introduced into the same program in a way that **the compiler or linker can’t tell them apart**, the **compiler or linker will produce an error**. 
- This error is generally referred to as a **naming collision** (or **naming conflict**).

## Example of a naming collision

a.cpp:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void myFcn(int x)
{
    std::cout << x;
}
```

main.cpp:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void myFcn(int x)
{
    std::cout << 2 * x;
}

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

- **Compiler** will **compile *a.cpp* and *main.cpp* independently**, and each file will c**ompile with no problems**.

- **Linker** will **link all the definitions in *a.cpp* and *main.cpp* together**, and d**iscover conflicting definitions** for function *myFcn*. The linker will then **abort with an error**. Note that **this error occurs even though *myFcn* is never called**.

## Two cases where most naming collisions occur

1. Two (or more) definitions for a function (or global variable) are introduced into **separate files that are compiled into the same program.** This will result in a **linker error**, as shown above.
2. Two (or more) definitions for a function (or global variable) are **introduced into the same file** (often via an #include). This will result in a **compiler error**.

- C++ provides plenty of mechanisms for avoiding naming collisions. 
- For example, **local scope**, which **keeps local variables defined inside functions** from conflicting with each other, is one such mechanism. 

## Namespaces

- A **namespace** is a **region that allows you to declare names inside of it for the purpose of disambiguation.** 
- The **namespace provides a scope region** (called **namespace scope**) to the names declared inside of it.

- A **name declared in a namespace** won’t be mistaken for an identical name declared in another scope.

- **Namespaces** are often used to **group related identifiers in a large project** to help ensure they don’t inadvsertently collide with other identifiers. 
- For example, if you put all your math functions in a **namespace called *math***, then your **math functions won’t collide with identically named functions outside the *math* namespace**.

## The global namespace

- In C++, any name that is **not defined inside a class, function, or a namespace** is considered to be **part of** the **global namespace** (a.k.a. **the global scope**).
- Only **declarations and definition statements** can appear in the global namespace. 
- We **can define variables in the global namespace**, though this should generally be avoided. 
- This also means that **other types of statements cannot be placed in the global namespace** (**initializers for global variables** being an exception):

```cpp
#include <iostream> // handled by preprocessor

// All of the following statements are part of the global namespace
void foo();    // okay: function forward declaration in the global namespace
int x;         // compiles but strongly discouraged: uninitialized variable definition in the global namespace
int y { 5 };   // compiles but discouraged: variable definition with initializer in the global namespace
x = 5;         // compile error: executable statements not allowed in the global namespace

int main()     // okay: function definition in the global namespace
{
    return 0;
}

void goo();    // okay: another function forward declaration in the global namespace
```

## The std namespace

- When C++ was originally designed, all of the **identifiers in the C++ standard library (including std::cin and std::cout) were available to be used without the *std::* prefix** (they were **part of the global namespace**). 
- This meant that any **identifier in the standard library could potentially conflict with any name you picked for your own identifiers**. 
- **Programs** that would compile under one version of C++ **might not compile under a future version of C++**, as **new identifiers introduced into the standard library** could have a naming conflict with already written code. 
- So **C++ moved all of the functionality in the standard library into a namespace named “std”** (short for **standard**).

- It turns out that ***std::cout* is actually just *cout***, and ***std* is the name of the namespace that identifier *cout* is part of.** 
- Because ***cout* is defined in the *std* namespace**, the name ***cout* won’t conflict with any objects or functions named *cout*** that we create in the global namespace.

## Tell the compiler 

- When you use an identifier that is defined inside a namespace (such as the *std* namespace), you have to tell the compiler that the identifier lives inside the namespace.

### Explicit namespace qualifier std::

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!"; // when we say cout, we mean the cout defined in the std namespace
    return 0;
}
```

- The **:: symbol** is an operator called the **scope resolution operator**. 
- The **identifier** to the **left of the :: symbol identifies the namespace** that the name to **the right of the :: symbol is contained within**. 
- If **no identifier to the left of the :: symbol** is provided, the **global namespace** is assumed.

- This is the **safest way to use *cout***

> Use explicit namespace prefixes to access identifiers defined in a namespace.

### Using namespace std

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std; // this is a using directive telling the compiler to check the std namespace when resolving identifiers with no prefix

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!"; // cout has no prefix, so the compiler will check to see if cout is defined locally or in namespace std
    return 0;
}
```

- A **using directive** tells the **compiler** to **check a specified namespace when trying to resolve an identifier that has no namespace prefix**. 
- When the **compiler** goes to **determine what identifier *cout* is**, it will **check both locally and in the *std* namespace.**

#### why to avoid it

```cpp
#include <iostream> // imports the declaration of std::cout

using namespace std; // makes std::cout accessible as "cout"

int cout() // declares our own "cout" function in the global namespace
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, world!"; // Compile error!  Which cout do we want here?  The one in the std namespace or the one we defined above?

    return 0;
}
```

- The above program doesn’t compile, because the **compiler now can’t tell whether we want the *cout* function that we defined, or the *cout* that is defined inside the *std* namespace.**

- When using a **using-directive** in this manner, ***any* identifier we define may conflict with *any* identically named identifier in the *std* namespace**. 
- It may **conflict** with **new identifiers** added to the std namespace in **future language revisions.** 

> Avoid using-directives (such as *using namespace std;*) at the top of your program or in header files.

> They violate the reason why namespaces were added in the first place.
