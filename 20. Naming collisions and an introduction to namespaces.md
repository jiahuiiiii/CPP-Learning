# 2.8 — Naming collisions and an introduction to namespaces

- C++ requires that all **identifiers** be **non-ambiguous**. 
- If **two identical identifiers** are introduced into the same program in a way that **the compiler or linker can’t tell them apart**, the **compiler or linker will produce an error**. 
- This error is generally referred to as a **naming collision** (or **naming conflict**).

## Example of a naming collision

a.cpp:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void myFcn(int x)
{
    std::cout << x;
}
```

main.cpp:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void myFcn(int x)
{
    std::cout << 2 * x;
}

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

- **Compiler** will **compile *a.cpp* and *main.cpp* independently**, and each file will c**ompile with no problems**.

- **Linker** will **link all the definitions in *a.cpp* and *main.cpp* together**, and d**iscover conflicting definitions** for function *myFcn*. The linker will then **abort with an error**. Note that **this error occurs even though *myFcn* is never called**.

## Two cases where most naming collisions occur

1. Two (or more) definitions for a function (or global variable) are introduced into **separate files that are compiled into the same program.** This will result in a **linker error**, as shown above.
2. Two (or more) definitions for a function (or global variable) are **introduced into the same file** (often via an #include). This will result in a **compiler error**.

- C++ provides plenty of mechanisms for avoiding naming collisions. 
- For example, **local scope**, which **keeps local variables defined inside functions** from conflicting with each other, is one such mechanism. 

## Namespaces

- A **namespace** is a **region that allows you to declare names inside of it for the purpose of disambiguation.** 
- The **namespace provides a scope region** (called **namespace scope**) to the names declared inside of it.

- A **name declared in a namespace** won’t be mistaken for an identical name declared in another scope.

- **Namespaces** are often used to **group related identifiers in a large project** to help ensure they don’t inadvsertently collide with other identifiers. 
- For example, if you put all your math functions in a **namespace called *math***, then your **math functions won’t collide with identically named functions outside the *math* namespace**.

## The global namespace

- In C++, any name that is **not defined inside a class, function, or a namespace** is considered to be **part of** an implicitly defined namespace called the **global namespace** (a.k.a. **the global scope**).

- In the example at the top of the lesson, functions main() and both versions of myFcn() are defined inside the global namespace. The naming collision encountered in the example happens because both versions of myFcn() end up inside the global namespace, which violates the rule that all names in the namespace must be unique.

Only declarations and definition statements can appear in the global namespace. This means we can define variables in the global namespace, though this should generally be avoided (we cover global variables in lesson [6.4 -- Introduction to global variables](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-global-variables/)). This also means that other types of statements (such as expression statements) cannot be placed in the global namespace (initializers for global variables being an exception):

```cpp
#include <iostream> // handled by preprocessor

// All of the following statements are part of the global namespace
void foo();    // okay: function forward declaration in the global namespace
int x;         // compiles but strongly discouraged: uninitialized variable definition in the global namespace
int y { 5 };   // compiles but discouraged: variable definition with initializer in the global namespace
x = 5;         // compile error: executable statements not allowed in the global namespace

int main()     // okay: function definition in the global namespace
{
    return 0;
}

void goo();    // okay: another function forward declaration in the global namespace
```

COPY

The std namespace

When C++ was originally designed, all of the identifiers in the C++ standard library (including std::cin and std::cout) were available to be used without the *std::* prefix (they were part of the global namespace). However, this meant that any identifier in the standard library could potentially conflict with any name you picked for your own identifiers (also defined in the global namespace). Code that was working might suddenly have a naming conflict when you #included a new file from the standard library. Or worse, programs that would compile under one version of C++ might not compile under a future version of C++, as new identifiers introduced into the standard library could have a naming conflict with already written code. So C++ moved all of the functionality in the standard library into a namespace named “std” (short for standard).

It turns out that *std::cout*‘s name isn’t really *std::cout*. It’s actually just *cout*, and *std* is the name of the namespace that identifier *cout* is part of. Because *cout* is defined in the *std* namespace, the name *cout* won’t conflict with any objects or functions named *cout* that we create in the global namespace.

Similarly, when accessing an identifier that is defined in a namespace (e.g. *std::cout*) , you need to tell the compiler that we’re looking for an identifier defined inside the namespace (*std*).

Key insight

When you use an identifier that is defined inside a namespace (such as the *std* namespace), you have to tell the compiler that the identifier lives inside the namespace.

There are a few different ways to do this.

Explicit namespace qualifier std::

The most straightforward way to tell the compiler that we want to use *cout* from the *std* namespace is by explicitly using the *std::* prefix. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!"; // when we say cout, we mean the cout defined in the std namespace
    return 0;
}
```

COPY

The :: symbol is an operator called the **scope resolution operator**. The identifier to the left of the :: symbol identifies the namespace that the name to the right of the :: symbol is contained within. If no identifier to the left of the :: symbol is provided, the global namespace is assumed.

So when we say *std::cout*, we’re saying “the *cout* that lives in namespace *std*“.

This is the safest way to use *cout*, because there’s no ambiguity about which *cout* we’re referencing (the one in the *std* namespace).

Best practice

Use explicit namespace prefixes to access identifiers defined in a namespace.

Using namespace std (and why to avoid it)

Another way to access identifiers inside a namespace is to use a *using directive* statement. Here’s our original “Hello world” program with a *using directive*:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std; // this is a using directive telling the compiler to check the std namespace when resolving identifiers with no prefix

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!"; // cout has no prefix, so the compiler will check to see if cout is defined locally or in namespace std
    return 0;
}
```

COPY

A **using directive** tells the compiler to check a specified namespace when trying to resolve an identifier that has no namespace prefix. So in the above example, when the compiler goes to determine what identifier *cout* is, it will check both locally (where it is undefined) and in the *std* namespace (where it will match to *std::cout*).

Many texts, tutorials, and even some compilers recommend or use a using-directive at the top of the program. However, used in this way, this is a bad practice, and highly discouraged.

Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // imports the declaration of std::cout

using namespace std; // makes std::cout accessible as "cout"

int cout() // declares our own "cout" function in the global namespace
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, world!"; // Compile error!  Which cout do we want here?  The one in the std namespace or the one we defined above?

    return 0;
}
```

The above program doesn’t compile, because the compiler now can’t tell whether we want the *cout* function that we defined, or the *cout* that is defined inside the *std* namespace.

When using a using-directive in this manner, *any* identifier we define may conflict with *any* identically named identifier in the *std* namespace. Even worse, while an identifier name may not conflict today, it may conflict with new identifiers added to the std namespace in future language revisions. This was the whole point of moving all of the identifiers in the standard library into the *std* namespace in the first place!
