# 4.12 — Introduction to type conversion and static_cast

## Implicit type conversion

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print(double x) // print takes an double parameter
{
	std::cout << x;
}

int main()
{
	print(5); // what happens when we pass an int value?

	return 0;
}
```

- The `print()` function has a **parameter of type `double`** but the caller is **passing** in the value `5` which is of **type `int`**. 

- In most cases, C++ will convert values of one fundamental type to another fundamental type. 
- The process of **converting a value from one type to another type** is called **type conversion**. 
- Thus, the **int argument `5` will be converted to double value `5.0`** and then copied into parameter `x`. 
- The `print()` function will print this value, resulting in the following output:

```
5
```

- When the **compiler does type conversion** for us, we call this **implicit type conversion**.

### Implicit type conversion warnings

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print(int x) // print now takes an int parameter
{
	std::cout << x;
}

int main()
{
	print(5.5); // warning: we're passing in a double value

	return 0;
}
```

- Unlike the initial example, when this program is compiled, your compiler will generate some kind of a warning about **a possible loss of data**. 

```
5
```

- Note that although we passed in value `5.5`, the program printed `5`. 
- Because **integral values can’t hold fractions**, when double value `5.5` is implicitly converted to an `int`, the **fractional component is dropped**, and only the integral value is retained.

- Some type conversions are always **safe** to make (such as **`int` to `double`**), whereas **others** may result in the **value being changed during conversion** (such as **`double` to `int`**). 
- **Unsafe implicit conversions** will typically either generate a compiler **warning**, or (in the case of **brace initialization**) an **error**.

- **Brace initialization** will **ensure we don’t try to initialize a variable with a initializer that will lose value** when it is implicitly type converted

  ```cpp
  int main()
  {
      double d { 5 }; // okay: int to double is safe
      int x { 5.5 }; // error: double to int not safe
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

## An introduction to explicit type conversion via the static_cast operator

- C++ supports a second type of type conversion, called **explicit type conversion.**
- **Explicit type conversion** allow us to explicitly tell the compiler to convert a value from one type to another type.

- To perform an explicit type conversion, in most cases we’ll use the **`static_cast` operator**. 

```
static_cast<new_type>(expression)
```

- static_cast takes the value from an **expression** as **input**, and returns that value converted into the type specified by *new_type* (e.g. int, bool, char, double).

- Whenever you see C++ syntax that makes use of **angled brackets (<>),** the thing between the angled brackets will most likely be a **type**. 
- This is typically how C++ deals with concepts that need a parameterizable type.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print(int x)
{
	std::cout << x;
}

int main()
{
	print( static_cast<int>(5.5) ); // explicitly convert double value 5.5 to an int

	return 0;
}
```

- Because we’re now **explicitly requesting** that double value `5.5` be converted to an `int` value, the compiler **will not generate a warning** about a possible loss of data upon compilation 

## Using static_cast to convert char to int

- Printing a char value using `std::cout` results in the value being printed as a char.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      char ch{ 97 }; // 97 is ASCII code for 'a'
      std::cout << ch << '\n';
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  ```
  a
  ```

- If we want to **print the integral value instead of the char,** we can do this by using `static_cast` to cast the value from a `char` to an `int`

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      char ch{ 97 }; // 97 is ASCII code for 'a'
      std::cout << ch << " has value " << static_cast<int>(ch) << '\n'; // print value of variable ch as an int
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  ```
   a has value 97
  ```

- The **variable itself** is ***not* affected by casting its value to a new type**. 
- In the above case, **variable `ch` is still a char**.

## Converting unsigned numbers to signed numbers

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    unsigned int u { 5u }; // 5u means the number 5 as an unsigned int
    int s { static_cast<int>(u) }; // return value of variable u as an int

    std::cout << s;
    return 0;
}
```

- The **static_cast operator** will **produce undefined behavior** if the **value being converted doesn’t fit in range of the new type**.

## std::int8_t and std::uint8_t likely behave like chars instead of integers

- Most compilers define and treat `std::int8_t` and `std::uint8_t` (and the corresponding fast and least fixed-width types) identically to types `signed char` and `unsigned char` respectively. 

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::int8_t myint{65}; // initialize myint with value 65
    std::cout << myint;    // you're probably expecting this to print 65

    return 0;
}
```

- On most systems, this program will print ‘A’ instead of the integral value `65`(**treating `myint` as a `signed char`**). 

- If you want to **ensure that a `std::int8_t` or `std::uint8_t` object is treated as an integer**, you can convert the value to an integer using `static_cast`

  ```cpp
  #include <cstdint>
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      std::int8_t myint{65};
      std::cout << static_cast<int>(myint); // will always print 65
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- In cases where `std::int8_t` is treated as a char, **input from the console** can also cause problems

  ```cpp
  #include <cstdint>
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "Enter a number between 0 and 255: ";
      std::int8_t myint{};
      std::cin >> myint;
  
      std::cout << "You entered: " << static_cast<int>(myint);
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  ```
  Enter a number between 0 and 255: 35
  You entered: 51
  ```

- When **`std::int8_t` is treated as a char**, the input routines **interpret our input as a sequence of characters, not as an integer**. 
- So when we **enter `35`**, we’re actually **entering two chars, `3` and `5`**. 
- Because **a char object can only hold one character, the `3` is extracted** (the **`5` is left in the input stream for possible extraction later**). s
- Because the **char `3` has ASCII code point 51**, the value **`51` is stored in `myint`**, which we then print later as an int.

- In contrast, the **other fixed-width types** will always **print and input as integral values.**
