# 1.6 — Uninitialized variables and undefined behavior

## Uninitialized variables

- Unlike some programming languages, **C/C++ does not initialize most variables to a given value (such as zero) automatically**. 
- **A variable that has not been given a known value** is called an **uninitialized variable**.

- **Initialization** means **the object was provided with an initial value at the point of definition**. 
- **Uninitialized** means **the object has not been given a known value (through any means, including assignment)**. 
- An **object that is not initialized but is then assigned a value is no longer *uninitialized*** (because it has been given a known value).

> To recap:
>
> - Initialization = The object is given a known value at the point of definition.
> - Assignment = The object is given a known value beyond the point of definition.
> - Uninitialized = The object has not been given a known value yet.

> This lack of initialization is a performance optimization inherited from C, back when computers were slow. Imagine a case where you were going to read in 100,000 values from a file. In such case, you might create 100,000 variables, then fill them with data from the file.

Once you are more comfortable with the language, there may be certain cases where you omit the initialization for optimization purposes. But this should always be done selectively and intentionally.

Using the values of uninitialized variables can lead to unexpected results.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // define an integer variable named x
    int x; // this variable is uninitialized because we haven't given it a value

    // print the value of x to the screen
    std::cout << x; // who knows what we'll get, because x is uninitialized

    return 0;
}
```

- In this case, the computer will assign some unused memory to *x*. 
- It will then send the value residing in that memory location to *std::cout*, which will print the value (interpreted as an integer). 
- But what value will it print? The answer may (or may not) change every time you run the program. When the author ran this program in Visual Studio, *std::cout* printed the value `4200987` one time, and `5277592` the next. 

- Most modern compilers will attempt to detect if a variable is being used without being given a value. If they are able to detect this, they will generally issue a compile-time error. 

```
c:\VCprojects\test\test.cpp(11) : warning C4700: uninitialized local variable 'x' used
```

- If your compiler won’t let you compile and run the above program for this reason, here is a possible solution to get around this issue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void doNothing(int&) // Don't worry about what & is for now, we're just using it to trick the compiler into thinking variable x is used
{
}

int main()
{
    // define an integer variable named x
    int x; // this variable is uninitialized

    doNothing(x); // make the compiler think we're assigning a value to this variable

    // print the value of x to the screen (who knows what we'll get, because x is uninitialized)
    std::cout << x;

    return 0;
}
```

- **Using uninitialized variables** is one of the **most common mistakes** that novice programmers make
- it can also be one of the most **challenging to debug**
  - the program **may run fine** anyway **if the uninitialized variable happened to get assigned to a spot of memory that had a reasonable value in it**, like 0

> always initialize your variables

## Undefined behavior

- Using the value from an **uninitialized variable** is our first **example of undefined behavior.** 
- **Undefined behavior** (often **abbreviated UB**) is the result of **executing code whose behavior is not well defined by the C++ language**. 
- The C++ language **doesn’t have any rules determining what happens if you use the value of a variable that has not been given a known value** so undefined behavior will result if you do so.

### **Symptoms that the code implementing undefined behavior** may exhibit

- Your program **produces different results every time it is run**.
- Your program **consistently produces the same incorrect result**.
- Your program **behaves inconsistently** (sometimes produces the correct result, sometimes not).
- Your program **seems like its working but produces incorrect results later in the program**.
- Your program **crashes**, either immediately or later.
- Your program **works on some compilers but not others**.
- Your program **works until you change some other seemingly unrelated code**.

- Your code **may actually produce the correct behavior anyway**. The nature of undefined behavior is that you never quite know what you’re going to get, whether you’ll get it every time, and whether that behavior will change when you make other changes.

> C++ contains many cases that can result in undefined behavior if you’re not careful. We’ll point these out in future lessons whenever we encounter them. Take note of where these cases are and make sure you avoid them.

> Take care to avoid all situations that result in undefined behavior, such as using uninitialized variables.
