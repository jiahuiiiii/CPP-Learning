# 1.5 — Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl

- In this lesson, we’ll talk more about std::cout, which we used in our *Hello world!* program to output the text *Hello world!* to the console. 
- We’ll also explore how to get input from the user, which we will use to make our programs more interactive.

## The input/output library

- The **input/output library** (a.k.a. io library) is part of **the C++ standard library that deals with basic input and output**. 
- We’ll use the functionality in this library **to get input from the keyboard and output data to the console**. The *io* part of *iostream* stands for *input/output*.

- To **use the functionality defined within the *iostream* library**, we **need to include the *iostream* header at the top** of any code file that uses the content defined in *iostream*, like so:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// rest of code that uses iostream functionality here
```

### std::cout

- The *iostream* library contains a few predefined variables for us to use. One of the most useful is **std::cout**, which allows us to s**end data to the console to be printed as text.** 
- *cout* stands for “**character output**”.

As a reminder, here’s our *Hello world* program:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!"; // print Hello world! to console

    return 0;
}
```

- In this program, we have **included *iostream* so that we have access to *std::cout***. Inside our ***main* function**, we use *std::cout*, along with the **insertion operator (`<<`)**, to **send the text *Hello world!* to the console to be printed**.

- ***std::cout* can not only print text, it can also print numbers**:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    std::cout << 4; // print 4 to console

    return 0;
}
```

This produces the result:

```
4
```

It can also be used to print the value of variables:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 }; // define integer variable x, initialized with value 5
    std::cout << x; // print value of x (5) to console
    return 0;
}
```

This produces the result:

```
5
```

To print more than one thing on the same line, the insertion operator (`<<`) can be used multiple times in a single statement to concatenate (link together) multiple pieces of output. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";
    return 0;
}
```

This program prints:

```
Hello world!
```

Here’s another example where we **print both text and the value of a variable** in the same statement:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x;
    return 0;
}
```

This program prints:

```
x is equal to: 5
```

### std::endl

What would you expect this program to print?

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hi!";
    std::cout << "My name is Alex.";
    return 0;
}
```

You might be surprised at the result:

```
Hi!My name is Alex.
```

- **Separate output statements don’t result in separate lines of output on the console.**

- If we **want to print separate lines of output to the console**, we need to **tell the console when to move the cursor to the next line**.

- One way to do that is to **use *std::endl***. **When output with *std::cout*, *std::endl* prints a newline character to the console** (causing the cursor to go to the start of the next line). In this context, *endl* stands for “**end line**”.

For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout and std::endl

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hi!" << std::endl; // std::endl will cause the cursor to move to the next line of the console
    std::cout << "My name is Alex." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This prints:

```
Hi!
My name is Alex.
```

- In the above program, the **second *std::endl* isn’t technically necessary**, since the **program ends immediately afterward**. However, it serves two useful purposes: First, **it helps indicate that the line of output is a “complete thought”** (as opposed to partial output that is completed somewhere later in the code). Second, **if we later want to add additional lines of output, we don’t have to modify the existing code.** We can just add them.

#### std::endl vs ‘\n’

- Using **std::endl** can be a bit **inefficient**, as it actually does two jobs: 
  - it moves the cursor to the next line, and **it “flushes” the output** (makes sure that it shows up on the screen immediately). 
  - When writing text to the console using std::cout, **std::cout often flushes output anyway** (and if it doesn’t, it usually doesn’t matter), so **having std::endl perform a flush is rarely important**.

- Because of this, use of **the ‘\n’ character is typically preferred instead**. The **‘\n’ character moves the cursor to the next line, but doesn’t request a flush**, so it will perform better in cases where a flush would not otherwise happen. 
- The **‘\n’ character also tends to be easier to read** since it’s both **shorter and can be embedded into existing text**.

Here’s an example that uses ‘\n’ in two different ways:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x << '\n'; // Using '\n' standalone
    std::cout << "And that's all, folks!\n"; // Using '\n' embedded into a double-quoted piece of text (note: no single quotes when used this way)
    return 0;
}
```

This prints:

```
x is equal to: 5
And that's all, folks!
```

- Note that when **‘\n’ is used by itself to move the cursor to the next line**, the **single quotes are needed**. 
- When **embedded into text that is already double-quoted**, the **single quotes aren’t needed.

> Prefer ‘\n’ over std::endl when outputting text to the console.

### std::cin

- `std::cin` is another predefined variable that is defined in the `iostream` library. 
- Whereas `std::cout` prints data to the console using the insertion operator (`<<`), `std::cin` (which stands for “**character input**”) **reads input from keyboard** using the **extraction operator (`>>`)**. 
- **The input must be stored in a variable to be used**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // for std::cout and std::cin

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: "; // ask user for a number

    int x{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
    std::cin >> x; // get number from keyboard and store it in variable x

    std::cout << "You entered " << x << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

- When you run the program, line 5 will print “Enter a number: “. 
- When the code gets to line 8, your **program will wait for you to enter input.** 
- Once you **enter a number (and press enter)**, **the number you enter will be assigned to variable *x***. 
- Finally, on line 10, the program will print “You entered ” followed by the number you just entered.

For example (I entered 4):

```
Enter a number: 4
You entered 4
```

- This is an easy way to **get keyboard input from the user**, and we will use it in many of our examples going forward. 
- Note that you **don’t need to use ‘\n’ when accepting input**, as the user will need to **press the *enter* key to have their input accepted**, and this will move the cursor to the next line.

- It's also possible to **input more than one value on a single line**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // for std::cout and std::cin

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter two numbers separated by a space: ";

    int x{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
    int y{ }; // define variable y to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
    std::cin >> x >> y; // get two numbers and store in variable x and y respectively

    std::cout << "You entered " << x << " and " << y << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

This produces the output:

```
Enter two numbers separated by a space: 5 6
You entered 5 and 6
```

- There’s some debate over whether it’s necessary to **initialize a variable immediately before you give it a user provided value via another source (e.g. std::cin)**, since the **user-provided value will just overwrite the initialization value**. 
- In line with our previous recommendation that **variables should always be initialized**, best practice is to **initialize the variable first**.

## Summary

New programmers often mix up **std::cin**, **std::cout**, the **insertion operator** (`<<`) and the **extraction operator** (`>>`). Here’s an easy way to remember:

- `std::cin` and `std::cout` always go on the left-hand side of the statement.
- `std::cout` is used to **output a value** (cout = character output)
- `std::cin` is used to **get an input value** (cin = character input)
- `<<` is used with std::cout, and shows the direction that data is moving (if `std::cout` represents the console, the output data is moving from the variable to the console). `std::cout << 4` moves the value of 4 to the console
- `>>` is used with `std::cin`, and shows the direction that data is moving (if std::cin represents the keyboard, the input data is moving from the keyboard to the variable). `std::cin >> x` moves the value the user entered from the keyboard into x.
