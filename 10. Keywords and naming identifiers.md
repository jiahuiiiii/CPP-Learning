# 1.7 — Keywords and naming identifiers

## Keywords

- **C++ reserves a set of 92 words** (as of C++20) for its own use. 
- These words are called **keywords** (a.k.a. **reserved words**), and each of these keywords **has a special meaning within the C++ language**.

- Here is a list of all the C++ keywords (through C++20):

  - alignas

  - alignof

  - and

  - and_eq

  - asm

  - auto

  - bitand

  - bitor

  - bool

  - break

  - case

  - catch

  - char

  - char8_t (since C++20)

  - char16_t

  - char32_t

  - class

  - compl

  - concept (since C++20)

  - const

  - consteval (since C++20)

  - constexpr

  - constinit (since C++20)

  - const_cast

  - continue

  - co_await (since C++20)

  - co_return (since C++20)

  - co_yield (since C++20)

  - decltype

  - default

  - delete

  - do

  - double

  - dynamic_cast

  - else

  - enum

  - explicit

  - export

  - extern

  - false

  - float

  - for

  - friend

  - goto

  - if

  - inline

  - noexcept

  - not

  - not_eq

  - nullptr

  - operator

  - or

  - or_eq

  - private

  - protected

  - public

  - register

  - reinterpret_cast

  - requires (since C++20)

  - return

  - short

  - signed

  - sizeof

  - static

  - static_assert

  - static_cast

  - struct

  - switch

  - template

  - this

  - thread_local

  - throw

  - true

  - try

  - typedef

  - typeid

  - typename

  - union

  - unsigned

  - using

  - virtual

  - void

  - volatile

  - wchar_t

  - while

  - xor

  - xor_eq

- The **keywords marked (C++20) were added in C++20**. These keywords may not be functional if your compiler is not C++20 compliant.

- C++ also defines **special identifiers: *override*, *final*, *import*, and *module***. These **have a specific meaning when used in certain contexts** but are **not reserved**.

- Along with **a set of operators**, these **keywords** and **special identifiers** **define the entire language of C++**.
- Because **keywords and special identifiers have special meaning**, your **IDEs will change the text color of these words to make them stand out** from other identifiers.

## Identifier naming rules

- The **name of a variable (or function, type, or other kind of item)** is called an **identifier**. 

- There **are a few rules** that must be followed **when naming identifiers**:

  - The **identifier can not be a keyword**. Keywords are reserved.

  - The identifier can only be composed of **letters** (lower or upper case), **numbers**, and the **underscore character**. 

  - The identifier **must begin with a letter or an underscore**. It **can not start with a number**.

  - C++ is **case sensitive**, and thus distinguishes between lower and upper case letters. `nvalue` is different than `nValue` is different than `NVALUE`.

### Identifier naming best practices

- First, it is a convention in C++ that **variable names should begin with a lowercase letter**. 
- If the **variable name is one word**, **the whole thing should be written in lowercase letters**.

```cpp
int value; // correct

int Value; // incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
int VALUE; // incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
int VaLuE; // incorrect (see your psychiatrist) ;)
```

- Most often, **function names are also started with a lowercase letter.** 
- Since **function *main*** (which all programs must have) **starts with a lowercase letter**, as do all of the functions in the C++ standard library.

- **Identifier names that start with a capital letter** are typically **used for user-defined types** (such as structs, classes, and enumerations).

- If the **variable or function name is multi-word**, there are two common conventions: words separated by underscores, called **snake_case,** or **intercapped** (a.k.a. **camelCase**).

```cpp
int my_variable_name; // correct (separated by underscores/snake_case)
int my_function_name(); // correct (separated by underscores/snake_case)

int myVariableName; // correct (intercapped/CamelCase)
int myFunctionName(); // correct (intercapped/CamelCase)

int my variable name; // invalid (whitespace not allowed)
int my function name(); // invalid (whitespace not allowed)

int MyVariableName; // valid but incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
int MyFunctionName(); // valid but incorrect (should start with lower case letter)
```

- We will typically use the **intercapped approach** because it’s **easier to read**.
- The **C++ standard library uses the underscore method** for both variables and functions. 
- Sometimes you’ll see a mix of the two: **underscores used for variables and intercaps used for functions**.

- You should **avoid naming your identifiers starting with an underscore**, as these names are typically reserved for OS, library, and/or compiler use.

- Your **identifiers should make clear what the value they are holding means**. 

  - An **identifier with a trivial use can have a short name** (e.g. such as *i*).

  - An **identifier that is used more broadly** (e.g. a function that is called from many different places in a program) **should have a longer and more descriptive name** (e.g. instead of *open*, try *openFileOnDisk*).

| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| int ccount         | Bad    | What does the c before “count” stand for?                    |
| int customerCount  | Good   | Clear what we’re counting                                    |
| int i              | Either | Okay if use is trivial, bad otherwise                        |
| int index          | Either | Okay if obvious what we’re indexing                          |
| int totalScore     | Either | Okay if there’s only one thing being scored, otherwise too ambiguous |
| int _count         | Bad    | Do not start names with underscore                           |
| int count          | Either | Okay if obvious what we’re counting                          |
| int data           | Bad    | What kind of data?                                           |
| int time           | Bad    | Is this in seconds, minutes, or hours?                       |
| int minutesElapsed | Good   | Descriptive                                                  |
| int value1, value2 | Either | Can be hard to differentiate between the two                 |
| int numApples      | Good   | Descriptive                                                  |
| int monstersKilled | Good   | Descriptive                                                  |
| int x, y           | Either | Okay if use is trivial, bad otherwise                        |

- **Avoid abbreviations**. Although they reduce the time you need to write your code, they **make your code harder to read**. Even if the abbreviation is unambiguous, **it takes the reader a moment to figure out what you meant**. 

> **Code is read more often than it is written**

- **A well placed comment on the declaration line should help the user figure it out**:

```cpp
// holds number of chars in a piece of text -- including whitespace and punctuation!
int numberOfChars;
```
