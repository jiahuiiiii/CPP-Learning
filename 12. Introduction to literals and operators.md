# 1.9 — Introduction to literals and operators

## Literals

Consider the following two statements:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!";
int x{ 5 };
```

- *“Hello world!”* and *5* are literals. 
- A **literal** (also known as a **literal constant**) is **a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code.**

- **Literals and variables both have a value (and a type)**. 
- **The value of a literal is fixed** and **can’t be changed** (hence it being called a **constant**), whereas the **value of a variable can be changed through initialization and assignment**.

## Operators

- In mathematics, an **operation** is a mathematical calculation involving zero or more input values (called **operands**) that produces a new value (called an **output value**). 
- The specific **operation** to be performed is **denoted by a construct** (typically **a symbol or pair of symbols**) called an **operator**.

- For example, *2 + 3* equals *5*. 
  - the literals *2* and *3* are the **operands**
  - the symbol *+* is the **operator** that tells us to **apply mathematical addition** on the **operands** to produce the new value *5*.

- For **operators that are symbols**, it is common nomenclature命名法 to **append the operator’s symbol to the word *operator***.
  - For example, the **plus operator** would be written ***operator+***, and the **extraction operator** would be written ***operator>>***.
- Examples of operators
  - **Standard arithmetic operators** from common usage in mathematics: **addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)**. 
  - **assignment (=)** operator,  **<< (insertion)** and >> **(extraction)** operator
  - **equality(==)** operator 
  - operators that are words (e.g. **new, delete, and throw**).

- The **number of operands that an operator takes as input** is called the **operator’s *arity***. **Operators in C++ come in three different *arities***:
  - **Unary** operators act on **one operand**. 
    - An example of a unary operator is the *- operator*. 
    - For example, given `-5`, *operator-* takes literal operand *5* and flips its sign to produce new output value *-5*.
  - **Binary** operators act on **two operands** (known as *left* and *right*). 
    - An example of a binary operator is the *+ operator*. 
    - For example, given `3 + 4`, *operator+* takes the left operand (3) and the right operand (4) and applies mathematical addition to produce new output value *7*. 
    - The insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators are binary operators, taking std::cout or std::cin on the left side, and the item to output or variable to input to on the right side.
  - **Ternary** operators act on three operands. 
    - There is only one of these in C++.

- Note that s**ome operators have more than one meaning** depending on how they are used. 
  - For example, ***operator-*** has two contexts. 
  - It can be used in **unary form to invert a number’s sign** (e.g. to convert 5 to -5, or vice versa) 
  - It can be used in **binary form to do subtraction** (e.g. 4 - 3).

### Chaining operators

- **Operators can be chained together** such that the **output of one operator can be used as the input for another operator**. 
- For example, given the following: *2 \* 3 + 4*, the multiplication operator goes first, and converts left operand *2* and right operand *3* into new value *6* (which becomes the left operand for the plus operator). Next, the plus operator executes, and converts left operand *6* and right operand *4* into new value 10.
- **The arithmetic operators execute in the same order as they do in standard mathematics**: Parenthesis first, then Exponents, then Multiplication & Division, then Addition & Subtraction.
