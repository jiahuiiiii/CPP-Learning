# 2.4 — Introduction to local scope

## Local variables

- **Function parameters**, as well as **variables defined inside the function body**, are called **local variables**.

```cpp
int add(int x, int y) // function parameters x and y are local variables
{
    int z{ x + y }; // z is a local variable too

    return z;
}
```

## Local variable lifetime

- We have discussed how a **variable definition such as `int x;`** causes t**he variable to be instantiated (created) when this statement is executed**. 
- **Function parameters** are **created and initialized when the function is entered**, and **variables within the function body** are **created and initialized at the point of definition**.

```cpp
int add(int x, int y) // x and y created and initialized here
{
    int z{ x + y }; // z created and initialized here

    return z;
}
```

- **Local variables** are **destroyed in the opposite order of creation** at the end of the set of curly braces in which it is defined (or **for a function parameter, at the end of the function**).

```cpp
int add(int x, int y)
{
    int z{ x + y };

    return z;
} // z, y, and x destroyed here
```

- An **object’s lifetime** is defined to be **the time between its creation and destruction**. 
- Note that **variable creation and destruction happen when the program is running** (a.k.a. runtime), **not at compile time.** 
- **Lifetime is a runtime property.**

Here’s a program demonstrating the lifetime of a variable named *x*:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void doSomething()
{
    std::cout << "Hello!\n";
}

int main()
{
    int x{ 0 }; // x's lifetime begins here

    doSomething(); // x is still alive during this function call

    return 0;
} // x's lifetime ends here
```

- In the above program, x**’s lifetime runs from the point of definition to the end of function *main***. This **includes the time spent during the execution of function *doSomething*.**

## Local scope

- An identifier’s **scope** determines **where the identifier can be accessed within the source code**. 
- When an **identifier can be accessed**, we say it is **in scope**. 
- When an **identifier can not be accessed**, we say it is **out of scope**. 
- Scope is a **compile-time property**, and **trying to use an identifier when it is not in scope** will result in a **compile error**.

- A **local variable’s scope** begins **at the point of variable definition**, and **stops at the end of the set of curly braces in which they are defined** (or for function parameters, **at the end of the function**). 

- **A local variable’s lifetime starts when it enters scope**, and **ends when it goes out of scope.**

- **Lifetime is a runtime property, and scope is a compile-time property**, so although we are talking about both in the same program, they are enforced at different points.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y) // x and y are created and enter scope here
{
    // x and y are visible/usable within this function only
    return x + y;
} // y and x go out of scope and are destroyed here

int main()
{
    int a{ 5 }; // a is created, initialized, and enters scope here
    int b{ 6 }; // b is created, initialized, and enters scope here

    // a and b are usable within this function only
    std::cout << add(a, b) << '\n'; // calls function add() with x=5 and y=6

    return 0;
} // b and a go out of scope and are destroyed here
```

- Parameters *x* and *y* are created when the *add* function is called, can only be seen/used within function *add*, and are destroyed at the end of *add*. 
- Variables *a* and *b* are created within function *main*, can only be seen/used within function *main*, and are destroyed at the end of *main*.

- The following happens, in order:

  - execution starts at the top of *main*

  - *main*‘s variable *a* is created and given value *5*

  - *main*‘s variable *b* is created and given value *6*

  - function *add* is called with values *5* and *6* for arguments

  - *add*‘s variable *x* is created and initialized with value *5*

  - *add*‘s variable *y* is created and initialized with value *6*

  - *operator+* evaluates expression *x + y* to produce the value *11*

  - *add* copies the value *11* back to caller *main*

  - *add*‘s *y* and *x* are destroyed

  - *main* prints 11 to the console

  - *main* returns *0* to the operating system

  - *main*‘s *b* and *a* are destroyed


- If **function *add* were to be called twice**, **parameters *x* and *y* would be created and destroyed twice** -- **once for each call.** 
- In a **program with lots of functions and function calls**, **variables are created and destroyed often.**

## Functional separation

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y) // add's x and y are created and enter scope here
{
    // add's x and y are visible/usable within this function only
    return x + y;
} // add's y and x go out of scope and are destroyed here

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 }; // main's x is created, initialized, and enters scope here
    int y{ 6 }; // main's y is created, initialized, and enters scope here

    // main's x and y are usable within this function only
    std::cout << add(x, y) << '\n'; // calls function add() with x=5 and y=6

    return 0;
} // main's y and x go out of scope and are destroyed here
```

- This program compiles and runs identically, even though **functions *main* and *add* both have variables named *x* and *y***. 

- Neither *add* nor *main* know that the other function has variables with the same names. 
- The **scopes don’t overlap**, it’s always clear to the compiler **which *x* and *y* are being referred to at any time**.

- **Names used for function parameters or variables** declared in a function body are **only visible within the function that declares them**. 
- **Local variables** within a function **can be named without regard for the names of variables in other functions**. This helps **keep functions independent**.

- **Local variables** inside the function body **should be defined as close to their first use as reasonable**
