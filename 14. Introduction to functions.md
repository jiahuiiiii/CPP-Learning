# 2.1 — Introduction to functions

- A **function** is a **reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job**.

- Every **executable program must have a function named *main*** (which is **where the program starts execution when it is run**). 
- As programs start to get longer and longer, **putting all the code inside the *main* function becomes increasingly hard to manage**. 
- Functions provide a way for us to **split our programs into small, modular chunks that are easier to organize, test, and use**. 
- The **C++ standard library** comes with **plenty of already-written functions** for you to use.
- Functions that you write yourself are called **user-defined functions**.

- A **program will be executing statements sequentially inside one function** when it **encounters a function call**. 
- A **function call** is an **expression that tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function**. 
- The CPU **“puts a bookmark” at the current point of execution**, and then **calls** **(executes) the function** named in the function call. When the **called function ends**, the CPU **returns back to the point it bookmarked, and resumes execution**.

- The **function initiating the function call** is called the **caller**, and the **function being called** is the **callee** or **called** **function**.

## User-defined function

```
return-type identifier() // identifier replaced with the name of your function
{
// Your code here
}
```

Let’s quickly go over the 4 main elements of this:

- In this lesson, we’ll use a ***return-type* of *int*** (for function *main()*) or *void* (otherwise). 
- Just like variables have names, so do user-defined functions. The ***identifier* is the name of your user-defined function**.
- The **parentheses** after the identifier **tell the compiler that we’re defining a function**.
- The **curly braces and statements in between** are called the **function body**. This is where the **statements** that are part of your function will go.

Here is a sample program that shows how a new function is defined and called:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

// Definition of user-defined function doPrint()
void doPrint() // doPrint() is the called function in this example
{
    std::cout << "In doPrint()\n";
}

// Definition of function main()
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Starting main()\n";
    doPrint(); // Interrupt main() by making a function call to doPrint().  main() is the caller.
    std::cout << "Ending main()\n"; // this statement is executed after doPrint() ends

    return 0;
}
```

This program produces the following output:

```
Starting main()
In doPrint()
Ending main()
```

> Don’t forget to include parentheses () after the function’s name when making a function call.

- Because a **function call was made**, **execution of statements in *main* is suspended**, and execution jumps to the top of called function *doPrint*. 
- The first (and only) line in *doPrint* prints `In doPrint()`. When *doPrint* terminates, execution returns back to the caller (here: function *main*) and resumes from the point where it left off. Consequently, the next statement executed in *main* prints `Ending main()`.

## Calling functions more than once

- Functions can be called more than once. 

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

void doPrint()
{
    std::cout << "In doPrint()\n";
}

// Definition of function main()
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Starting main()\n";
    doPrint(); // doPrint() called for the first time
    doPrint(); // doPrint() called for the second time
    std::cout << "Ending main()\n";

    return 0;
}
```

```
Starting main()
In doPrint()
In doPrint()
Ending main()
```

- Since ***doPrint* gets called twice by *main***, ***doPrint* executes twice**, and *In doPrint()* gets printed twice.

## Functions calling functions calling functions

- Any **function can call any other function**. In the following program, function *main* calls function *doA*, which calls functsion *doB*:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

void doB()
{
    std::cout << "In doB()\n";
}


void doA()
{
    std::cout << "Starting doA()\n";

    doB();

    std::cout << "Ending doA()\n";
}

// Definition of function main()
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Starting main()\n";

    doA();

    std::cout << "Ending main()\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This program produces the following output:

```
Starting main()
Starting doA()
In doB()
Ending doA()
Ending main()
```

## Nested functions are not supported

- In C++, **functions cannot be defined inside other functions**. The following program is not legal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    void foo() // Illegal: this function is nested inside function main()
    {
        std::cout << "foo!\n";
    }

    foo(); // function call to foo()
    return 0;
}
```

The proper way to write the above program is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void foo() // no longer inside of main()
{
    std::cout << "foo!\n";
}

int main()
{
    foo();
    return 0;
}
```

- **“foo” is a meaningless word that is often used as a placeholder name for a function or variable when the name is unimportant to the demonstration of some concept**. (a.k.a metasyntactic variable or placeholder names)
- Other common metasyntactic variables in C++ include “bar”, “baz”, and 3-letter words that end in “oo”, such as “goo”, “moo”, and “boo”).
