# 1.2 — Comments

- A **comment** is a **programmer-readable note** that is **inserted directly into the source code** of the program. 

- Comments are **ignored by the compiler** and are **for the programmer’s use only**.

- In C++ there are **two different styles of comments**, both of which serve the same purpose: to **help programmers document the code in some way**.

## Single-line comments

- The `//` symbol begins a **C++ single-line comment**, which **tells the compiler to ignore everything from the *//* symbol to the end of the line**. 

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!"; // Everything from here to the end of the line is ignored
```

- Typically, the single-line comment is **used to make a quick comment about a single line of code.**

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!\n"; // std::cout lives in the iostream library
std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n"; // these comments make the code hard to read
std::cout << "Yeah!\n"; // especially when lines are different lengths
```

- **Having comments** to the **right of a line** can make both the code and the comment **hard to read**, particularly if **the line is long**. If the lines are fairly **short**, the **comments can simply be aligned (usually to a tab stop)**, like so:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!\n";                 // std::cout lives in the iostream library
std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n"; // this is much easier to read
std::cout << "Yeah!\n";                        // don't you think so?
```

- However, if the lines are long, placing comments to the right can make your lines really long. In that case, **single-line comments are often placed above the line** it is commenting:

```cpp
// std::cout lives in the iostream library
std::cout << "Hello world!\n";

// this is much easier to read
std::cout << "It is very nice to meet you!\n";

// don't you think so?
std::cout << "Yeah!\n";
```

- The statements above represent one of our first encounters with snippets of code. Because snippets aren’t full programs, they aren’t able to be compiled by themselves. Rather, they exist to **demonstrate specific concepts in a concise manner.

## Multi-line comments

The **`/*` and `*/` pair of symbols** denotes a C-style **multi-line comment**. **Everything in between the symbols is ignored.**

```cpp
/* This is a multi-line comment.
   This line will be ignored.
   So will this one. */
```

### **“beautify” multi-line comments**:

```cpp
/* This is a multi-line comment.
 * the matching asterisks to the left
 * can make this easier to read
 */
```

**Multi-line style comments can not be nested**. Consequently, the following will have unexpected results:

```cpp
/* This is a multi-line /* comment */ this is not inside the comment */
// The above comment ends at the first */, not the second */
```

When the compiler tries to compile this, it will **ignore everything from the first `/*` to the first  `*/`**. “this is not inside the comment \*/*” is not considered part of the comment, the compiler will try to compile it. That will inevitably result in a compile error.

This is one place where using a **syntax highlighter can be really useful**, as the different coloring for comment should make clear what’s considered part of the comment vs not.

- Don’t use multi-line comments inside other multi-line comments. 
- Wrapping single-line comments inside a multi-line comment is okay.

## Proper use of comments

### First

- For a **given library, program, or function**, comments are best used to **describe *what* the library, program, or function does**. 
- These are typically **placed at the top of the file or library,** or immediately **preceding the function**. 

```cpp
// This program calculates the student's final grade based on his test and homework scores.
```

```cpp
// This function uses Newton's method to approximate the root of a given equation.
```

```cpp
// The following lines generate a random item based on rarity, level, and a weight factor.
```

- All of these comments **give the reader a good idea of what the library, program, or function is trying to accomplish without having to look at the actual code**. 
- This is particularly important when **working as part of a team**, where **not everybody will be familiar with all of the code**.

### Second

**within a library, program, or function described above**, comments can be used to **describe *how* the code is going to accomplish its goal**.

```cpp
/* To calculate the final grade, we sum all the weighted midterm and homework scores
    and then divide by the number of scores to assign a percentage, which is
    used to calculate a letter grade. */
```

```cpp
// To generate a random item, we're going to do the following:
// 1) Put all of the items of the desired rarity on a list
// 2) Calculate a probability for each item based on level and weight factor
// 3) Choose a random number
// 4) Figure out which item that random number corresponds to
// 5) Return the appropriate item
```

- These comments give the user an idea of how the code is going to accomplish its goal without having to understand what each individual line of code does.

### Third

- At the **statement level**, comments should be used to **describe *why* the code is doing something**. 

- A **bad statement comment explains *what* the code is doing**. 

  > If you ever write code that is so complex that needs a comment to explain *what* a statement is doing, you probably need to rewrite your statement, not comment it.

#### Comparisons between bad and good comments

Bad comment:

```cpp
// Set sight range to 0
sight = 0;
```

Reason: We already can see that sight is being set to 0 by looking at the statement

Good comment:

```cpp
// The player just drank a potion of blindness and can not see anything
sight = 0;
```

Reason: Now we know why the player’s sight is being set to 0

------

Bad comment:

```cpp
// Calculate the cost of the items
cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice;
```

Reason: We can see that this is a cost calculation, but why is quantity multiplied by 2?

Good comment:

```cpp
// We need to multiply quantity by 2 here because they are bought in pairs
cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice;
```

Reason: Now we know why this formula makes sense.

------

- **Programmers often have to make a tough decision between solving a problem one way, or solving it another way**. 
- Comments are a great way to **remind** yourself (or tell somebody else) **the reason you made one decision instead of another**.

Good comments:

```cpp
// We decided to use a linked list instead of an array because
// arrays do insertion too slowly.
```

```cpp
// We're going to use Newton's method to find the root of a number because
// there is no deterministic way to solve these equations.
```

- Finally, **comments should be written in a way that makes sense to someone who has no idea what the code does**. 

- You (or someone else) will thank you later for **writing down the what, how, and why of your code** in human language. 

  > Reading individual lines of code is easy. Understanding what goal they are meant to accomplish is not.

## Commenting out code

**Converting one or more lines of code into a comment** is called **commenting out** your code. This provides a convenient way to (temporarily) **exclude parts of your code from being included in your compiled program**.

To **comment out a single line of code**, simply **use the // style comment** to turn a line of code into a comment temporarily:

Uncommented out:

```cpp
std::cout << 1;
```

Commented out:

```cpp
//    std::cout << 1;
```

To comment out a block of code, **use // on multiple lines of code, or the /* */ style comment to turn the block of code into a comment temporarily**.

Uncommented out:

```cpp
std::cout << 1;
std::cout << 2;
std::cout << 3;
```

Commented out:

```cpp
//    std::cout << 1;
//    std::cout << 2;
//    std::cout << 3;
```

or

```cpp
/*
    std::cout << 1;
    std::cout << 2;
    std::cout << 3;
*/
```

There are quite a few reasons you might want to do this:

1. You’re working on a **new piece of code that won’t compile yet**, and you **need to run the program**. **The compiler won’t let you compile** the code **if there are compiler errors**. **Commenting out the code** that won’t compile will **allow the program to compile so you can run it**. When you’re **ready**, you can **uncomment the code, and continue working on it.**
2. You’ve written new **code that compiles but doesn’t work correctly**, and you **don’t have time to fix it until later**. **Commenting out the broken code** will **ensure the broken code doesn’t execute and cause problems until you can fix it.**
3. To **find the source of an error**. If a **program isn’t producing the desired results** (or is crashing), it can sometimes be useful to **disable parts of your code to see if you can isolate what’s causing it to not work correctly**. 
4. You want **to replace one piece of code with another piece of code**. You can **comment the original code out** and leave it there for reference **until you’re sure your new code works properly**.
