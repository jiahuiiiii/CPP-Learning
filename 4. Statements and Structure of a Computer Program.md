# 1.1 — Statements and the structure of a program

## Statements

- A **computer program** is a **sequence of instructions** that tell the computer what to do. 
- A **statement** is **a type of instruction** that causes the program to *perform some action*.

- Statements are by far the **most common type of instruction in a C++ program**. 
- When we want to convey an idea to another person, we typically write or speak in **sentences (not in random words or syllables)**. In **C++**, when we want to **have our program do something**, we typically **write statements**.

- **Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon**. If you see a line that ends in a semicolon, it’s probably a statement.

- In a **high-level language such as C++**, a **single statement may compile into many machine language instructions**.

### Statements in C++:

1. Declaration statements
2. Jump statements
3. Expression statements
4. Compound statements
5. Selection statements (conditionals)
6. Iteration statements (loops)
7. Try blocks

## Functions and the main function

- In C++, **statements are typically grouped into** units called **functions**. 
- A **function** is a **collection of statements that executes sequentially** (from top to bottom). 

> ### Rule
>
> Every C++ program must have a special function named **main** (all lower case letters). When the program is run, the statements inside of *main* are executed in sequential order.

- Programs typically terminate (finish running) when the last statement inside function *main* has executed (though programs may abort early in some circumstances, or do some cleanup afterwards).

- Functions are typically written to do a specific job. 
  - For example, a function named “max” might contain statements that figures out which of two numbers is larger. 
  - A function named “calculateGrade” might calculate a student’s grade from a set of test scores. 

- It’s fairly common shorthand to **append a pair of parenthesis to the end of the function’s name**. 
  - For example, if you see the term ***main()*** or ***doSomething()***, this is s**horthand for functions named *main* or *doSomething* respectively**. 
  - This helps **differentiate functions** from other things with names (such as variables) **without having to write the word “function” each time**.

## Dissecting Hello world!

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}
```

- Line 1 is a special type of line called a **preprocessor directive**. This preprocessor directive **indicates that we would like to use the contents of the iostream library**, which is the part of the C++ standard library that allows us to read and write text from/to the console. 
- We need this line **in order to use std::cout on line 5**. Excluding this line would result in a compile error on line 5, as the compiler wouldn’t otherwise know what std::cout is.

- Line 2 is **blank**, and is **ignored by the compiler**. This line exists only to **help make the program more readable** to humans (by **separating the #include preprocessor directive and the subsequent parts of the program**).

- Line 3 tells the compiler that we’re going to **write (define) a function called *main***. As you learned above, **every C++ program must have a *main* function** or it will **fail to link**.

- Lines 4 and 7 tell the compiler **which lines are part of the *main* function**. Everything **between the opening curly brace on line 4 and the closing curly brace on line 7 is considered part of the *main* function.** This is called the **function body.**

- Line 5 is the **first statement within function *main***, and is the first statement that **will execute when we run our program**. ***std::cout*** (a.k.a.“**character output**”) and **the `<<` operator allow us to send letters or numbers to the console to be output**. In this case, we’re sending it the text “Hello world!”, which will be output to the console. **This statement creates the visible output of the program.**

- Line 6 is a **return statement**. When **an executable program finishes running, the program sends a value back to the operating system** in order **to indicate whether it ran successfully or not**. This particular return statement returns the **value of 0** to the operating system, which means “**everything went okay**!”. This is the **last statement in the program that executes**.

## Syntax and syntax errors

- **Syntax in C++**: **rules about how your programs must be constructed in order to be considered valid.** 
- If you **violate a rule of C++ when you compile your program**, the **compiler** will **issue** you a **syntax error**.

### Example

if we **omit the semicolon** on line 5 of the “Hello world” program, like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!"
   return 0;
}
```

```
c:\vcprojects\test1.cpp(6): error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'return'
```

- This is telling you that you have a syntax error on line 6: 
  - the compiler was **expecting a semicolon before the return statement**, but it didn’t find one. Although the compiler will tell you which line of code it was compiling when it encountered the syntax error, **the omission may actually be on a previous line**. In this case, the error is actually at the end of line 5 (the compiler didn’t discover the issue until line 6).

- Syntax errors are common but typically straightforward to find and fix, as the compiler will generally point you right at them. Compilation of a program will only complete once all syntax errors are resolved.
