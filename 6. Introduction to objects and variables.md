# 1.3 — Introduction to objects and variables

## Data

- **Majority of instructions in a program are statements**, and that **statements are grouped into functions**. 
- These **statements perform actions that generate whatever result the program was designed to produce**.

- **Programs actually produce result by manipulating (reading, changing, and writing) data**. 
- In computing, **data** is **any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer.**

> Programs are collections of instructions that manipulate data to produce a desired result.

- A **program can acquire data to work with in** many ways: 

  - **from a file or database**
  - **over a network**
  - from the **user providing input** on a keyboard
  - from the **programmer putting data directly into the source code** of the program itself

  > In the “Hello world” program from the aforementioned lesson, the text “Hello world!” was inserted directly into the source code of the program, providing data for the program to use. The program then manipulates this data by sending it to the monitor to be displayed.

- **Data** on a computer is **typically stored in a format that is efficient for storage or processing** (and is thus **not human readable**). 
- When the “Hello World” program is compiled, the **text “Hello world!” is converted into a more efficient format for the program to use** (**binary**).

## Objects and variables

- All computers have memory, called **RAM** (short for **random access memory**), that is **available for your programs to use**. 
- You can think of RAM as **a series of numbered mailboxes** that can each be **used to hold a piece of data while the program is running**. 
- A **single piece of data**, stored in memory somewhere, is called a **value**.

- In some **older programming languages** (like Apple Basic), you **could directly access these mailboxes** (a statement could say something like *go get the value stored in mailbox number 7532*).

- **Direct memory access is not allowed in C++.** 
- Instead, **we access memory indirectly through an object**. 
- An **object** is a **region of storage (usually memory)** that **has a value and other associated properties**. 
- But the key point here is that rather than say *go get the value stored in mailbox number 7532*, we can say, ***go get the value stored by this object***. 
- This means we can **focus on using objects to store and retrieve values**, and **not have to worry about where in memory they’re actually being placed**.

- Objects **can be named or unnamed (anonymous)**. 
- A **named object** is called a **variable**[wtf so variable is actually object, wow interesting], and the **name of the object** is called an **identifier**. 
- **Most of the objects we create and use will be variables**.

- In **general programming**, the **term *object*** typically refers to **a variable, data structure in memory, or function**. **In C++,** the **term *object* has a narrower definition** that **excludes functions**.

## Variable instantiation

- In order to create a variable, we use a special kind of **declaration statement** called a **definition**.

Here’s an example of defining a variable named x:

```cpp
int x; // define a variable named x, of type int
```

- At compile time, when the compiler sees this statement, it makes a note to itself that we are **defining a variable**, giving it the **name *x***, and that it is of **type *int***. From that point forward, whenever the **compiler sees the identifier *x***, it will **know that we’re referencing this variable**.

- When the program is run (called **runtime**), the variable will be instantiated. **Instantiation** is a fancy word that means the **object will be created and assigned a memory address**. 
- **Variables must be instantiated before they can be used to store values**. 
- Let’s say that variable *x* is instantiated at memory location 140. Whenever the program uses variable x, it will access the value in memory location 140. 
- An **instantiated object** is sometimes also called an **instance**.

## Data types

- So far, we’ve covered that **variables are a named region of storage that can store a data value**. 

- A **data type** (more commonly just called a **type**) tells the compiler what type of value (e.g. a number, a letter, text, etc…) the variable will store.

- In the above example, our **variable *x* was given type *int***, which means **variable x will represent an integer value**. An **integer** is a **number that can be written without a fractional component**, such as 4, 27, 0, -2, or -12. For short, we can say that ***x* is an *integer variable***.

- In C++, the type of a variable must be known at **compile-time** (when the program is compiled), and that **type can not be changed without recompiling the program**. This means **an integer variable can only hold integer values**. If you want **to store some other kind of value, you’ll need to use a different variable**.

Integers are just one of many types that C++ supports out of the box. For illustrative purposes, here’s another example of defining a variable using data type *double*:

```cpp
double width; // define a variable named width, of type double
```

- **C++ also allows you to create your own user-defined types**,  and it’s part of what makes C++ powerful.

## Defining multiple variables

**It is possible to define multiple variables *of the same type* in a single statement** by separating the names with a comma. The following 2 snippets of code are effectively the same:

```cpp
int a;
int b;
```

is the same as:

```cpp
int a, b;
```

When defining multiple variables this way, there are **two common mistakes that new programmers tend to make**:

The first mistake is **giving each variable a type when defining variables in sequence**.

```cpp
int a, int b; // wrong (compiler error)

int a, b; // correct
```

The second mistake is to **try to define variables of different types in the same statement**, which is not allowed. **Variables of different types must be defined in separate statements**.

```cpp
int a, double b; // wrong (compiler error)

int a; double b; // correct (but not recommended)

// correct and recommended (easier to read)
int a;
double b;
```

- Although the language allows you to do so, **avoid defining multiple variables in a single statement (even if they are the same type)**. 
- **Define each variable in a separate statement** (and then **use a single-line comment to document** what it is used for).

## Summary

- In C++, we **use variables to access memory**. 
- **Variables** have an **identifier, a type, and a value**.
-  A **variable’s type is used to determine how the value in memory should be interpreted**.
