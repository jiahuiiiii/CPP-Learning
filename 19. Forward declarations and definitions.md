# 2.6 — Forward declarations and definitions

## Example 1

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
    return 0;
}

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
```

Expected result:

```
The sum of 3 and 4 is: 7
```

But in fact, the compiler will produce a compile error:

```
add.cpp(5) : error C3861: 'add': identifier not found
```

- The **compiler compiles the code sequentially**. 
- We haven’t defined *add* until line 9, when the compiler reaches the function call to *add* on line 5 of *main*, it doesn’t know what *add* is
- That produces the error, ***identifier not found***.

> When addressing compile errors in your programs, always resolve the first error produced first and then compile again.

- To fix this problem, we need to address the fact that **the compiler doesn’t know what add is**. There are two common ways to address the issue.

### Option 1: Reorder the function definitions

- One way to address the issue is to reorder the function definitions so ***add* is defined before *main***.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

- By the time *main* calls *add*, the compiler will already know what *add* is. 
- Because this is such a **simple program**, this **change** is relatively **easy** to do. 
- However, in a **larger program**, it can be tedious无趣的 trying to figure out **which functions call which other functions** (and in what **order**) so they can be declared sequentially.

- This option is **not always possible**. 
  - Let’s say we’re writing **a program that has two functions *A* and *B***. 
  - If **function *A* calls function *B***, and **function *B* calls function *A***, then there’s no way to order the functions in a way that will make the compiler happy. 

### Option 2: Use a forward declaration

- We can also fix this by using a forward declaration.

- A **forward declaration** allows us to **tell the compiler about the existence of an identifier *before* actually defining the identifier**.

- In the case of **functions**, this allows us to **tell the compiler about the existence of a function before we define the function’s body**. 

- We use a **declaration statement** called a **function prototype** to write a forward declaration for a function.
- The **function prototype** consists of the **function’s return type, name, parameters, but no function body**, terminated with a **semicolon**.

Here’s a function prototype for the *add* function:

```cpp
int add(int x, int y); // function prototype includes return type, name, parameters, and semicolon.  No function body!
```

Now, here’s our original program that didn’t compile, using a function prototype as a forward declaration for function *add*:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y); // forward declaration of add() (using a function prototype)

int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n'; // this works because we forward declared add() above
    return 0;
}

int add(int x, int y) // even though the body of add() isn't defined until here
{
    return x + y;
}
```

- When the compiler reaches the call to *add* in main, it will know what *add* looks like, and it won’t complain.

- Function prototypes **do not need to specify the names of the parameters.** You can also forward declare your function like this:

```cpp
int add(int, int); // valid function prototype
```

- When defining function prototypes, we prefer to **keep the parameter names**. 
- You can easily create forward declarations by copy/pasting your function’s prototype and adding a semicolon.

#### Forgetting the function body

- What will happen if we **forward declare a function but do not define it**?

1. If the **function is never called**, the program will **compile and run fine**. 
2. If the **function is called**, the program will compile okay, but the **linker will complain that it can’t resolve the function call**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y); // forward declaration of add() using function prototype

int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
    return 0;
}

// note: No definition for function add
```

```
Starting build...
undefined reference to `add(int, int)'
collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Build finished with error(s).
```

- The program **compiled okay**, but it **failed at the link stage** because *int add(int, int)* was never defined.

#### Other types of forward declarations

- Forward declarations are most often used with functions. 
- Forward declarations can also be used with other identifiers in C++, such as variables and user-defined types. 

## Declarations vs. definitions

### Definitions

- A **definition** actually **implements** (for functions or types) or **instantiates** (for variables) **the identifier**.

  ```cpp
  int add(int x, int y) // implements function add()
  {
      int z{ x + y }; // instantiates variable z
  
      return z;
  }
  ```

- A **definition** is needed to **satisfy the *linker***. 
- If you use an **identifier without providing a definition**, the linker will **error**.

#### The **one definition rule** (ODR)

1. Within a given ***file***, **a function, object, type, or template can only have one definition**.
2. Within a given ***program***, **an object or normal function can only have one definition**. This distinction is made because **programs can have more than one file.**
3. Types, templates, inline functions, and variables are **allowed to have identical definitions in different files**. 

- Violating **part 1** of the ODR will cause the **compiler** to issue a **redefinition error**. 
- Violating ODR **part 2** will likely cause the **linker** to issue a **redefinition error**. 
- Violating ODR **part 3** will cause **undefined behavior**.

Here’s an example of a violation of part 1:

```cpp
int add(int x, int y)
{
     return x + y;
}

int add(int x, int y) // violation of ODR, we've already defined function add
{
     return x + y;
}

int main()
{
    int x;
    int x; // violation of ODR, we've already defined x
}
```

```
project3.cpp(9): error C2084: function 'int add(int,int)' already has a body
project3.cpp(3): note: see previous definition of 'add'
project3.cpp(16): error C2086: 'int x': redefinition
project3.cpp(15): note: see declaration of 'x'
```

### Declarations

- A **declaration** is a **statement that tells the *compiler* about the existence of an identifier** and its **type information**.

  ```cpp
  int add(int x, int y); // tells the compiler about a function named "add" that takes two int parameters and returns an int.  No body!
  int x;// tells the compiler about an integer variable named x

- A **declaration** is needed to **satisfy the compiler**. 
- This is why we can use a forward declaration to tell the compiler about an identifier that isn’t actually defined until later.

- In C++, **all definitions also serve as declarations**. 
  - *int x* appears in our examples for both definitions and declarations. 
  - Since *int x* is a definition, it’s a declaration too. 
  - A **definition** serves our purposes because it **satisfies both the compiler and linker**. 
  - We only need to **provide an explicit declaration** when we want **to use an identifier before it has been defined**.

- All **declarations are not definitions.** 

  - **Function prototype satisfies the compiler**, but **not the linker.** 
  - These **declarations that aren’t definitions** are called **pure declarations**. 
  - Other types of **pure declarations** include **forward declarations for variables and type declarations**.

  - The **ODR doesn’t apply to pure declarations** so you **can have as many pure declarations for an identifier.**


###  Meaning of terms

- The term “**declaration**” is typically used to mean “a **pure declaration**”
- “**definition**” is used to mean “a **definition that also serves as a declaration**”. 
- Thus, we’d typically call *int x;* a definition, even though it is both a definition and a declaration.
