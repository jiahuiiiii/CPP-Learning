# 2.9 — Introduction to the preprocessor

## Translation and the preprocessor

### Translation

- The code file goes through a phase known as **translation** before compilation.
- Many things happen in the **translation phase** to **get your code ready to be compiled.**
- **A code file with translations applied to it** is called a **translation unit**.

### The Preprocessor

- The **preprocessor** is best thought of as **a separate program that manipulates the text in each code file**.

- It **scans through the code file** (from top to bottom), l**ooking for preprocessor directives**. 
- **Preprocessor directives** (a.k.a. *directives*) are **instructions that start with a *#* symbol and end with a newline** (**NOT a semicolon**). 
- These **directives tell the preprocessor to perform specific particular text manipulation tasks**. 
- Note that the **preprocessor does not understand C++ syntax** -- instead, the **directives have their own syntax**.
- The preprocessor **does not modify the original code files**
- All text **changes made by the preprocessor happen temporarily in-memory each time the code file is compiled.**

- `Using directives`are not preprocessor directives.

## Includes

- When you *#include* a file, the **preprocessor replaces the #include directive with the contents of the included file**. 
- The **included contents are then preprocessed (along with the rest of the file), and then compiled.**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!";
    return 0;
}
```

- When the preprocessor runs on this program, **the preprocessor will replace `#include <iostream>` with the preprocessed contents of the file named “iostream”.**

## Macro defines

- The ***#define* directive** can be used to **create a macro.** 
- In C++, a **macro** is a rule that **defines how input text is converted into replacement output text.**

- There are two basic types of macros: ***object-like macros*, and *function-like macros***.

- ***Function-like macros* act like functions**, and **almost anything they can do can be done by a normal function**.

### Object-like macros

- *Object-like macros* can be defined in one of two ways:

  ```cpp 
  #define identifier
  #define identifier substitution_text

#### Object-like macros with substitution text

- When the preprocessor encounters this directive, **any further occurrence of the identifier is replaced by *substitution_text***. 
- The **identifier is traditionally typed in all capital letters, using underscores to represent spaces.**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define MY_NAME "Alex"

int main()
{
    std::cout << "My name is: " << MY_NAME;

    return 0;
}
```

The preprocessor converts the above into the following:

```cpp
// The contents of iostream are inserted here

int main()
{
    std::cout << "My name is: " << "Alex";

    return 0;
}
```

- Which, when run, prints the output `My name is: Alex`.

- Object-like macros were **used as a cheaper alternative to constant variables**.
- We recommend **avoiding** these kinds of macros altogether.

#### Object-like macros without substitution text

- *Object-like macros* can also be defined without substitution text.

  ```cpp
  #define USE_YEN
  ```

- Any further occurrence of the identifier is **removed and replaced by nothing**.

- This might seem pretty useless, and it *is useless* for doing text substitution. However, **that’s not what this form of the directive is generally used for.**

- Unlike object-like macros with substitution text, **macros of this form** are generally considered **acceptable** to use.

## Conditional compilation

- The ***conditional compilation* preprocessor directives** allow you to s**pecify under what conditions something will or won’t compile.** 

### #ifdef

- The ***#ifdef* preprocessor directive** allows the preprocessor to **check whether an identifier has been previously *#define*d**. 

- If so, the **code between the *#ifdef* and matching *#endif* is compiled**. If not, the **code is ignored**.

- ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  #define PRINT_JOE
  
  int main()
  {
  #ifdef PRINT_JOE
      std::cout << "Joe\n"; // will be compiled since PRINT_JOE is defined
  #endif
  
  #ifdef PRINT_BOB
      std::cout << "Bob\n"; // will be ignored since PRINT_BOB is not defined
  #endif
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- PRINT_JOE **has been #defined**, the line `std::cout << "Joe\n"` will be **compiled**. 

- PRINT_BOB **has not been #defined**, the line `std::cout << "Bob\n"` will be **ignored**.

### #ifndef

- *#ifndef* is the **opposite of *#ifdef***, in that it allows you to **check whether an identifier has *NOT* been *#define*d yet.**

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
  #ifndef PRINT_BOB
      std::cout << "Bob\n";
  #endif
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- This program **prints** “Bob”, because PRINT_BOB **was never *#define*d.**

- In place of `#ifdef PRINT_BOB` and `#ifndef PRINT_BOB`, you’ll also see `#if defined(PRINT_BOB)` and `#if !defined(PRINT_BOB)`. These **do the same**, but use a slightly **more C++-style syntax**.

### \#if 0

-  Use***#if 0*** to **exclude a block of code from being compiled**

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "Joe\n";
  
  #if 0 // Don't compile anything starting here
      std::cout << "Bob\n";
      std::cout << "Steve\n";
  #endif // until this point
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- The above code only prints “Joe”, because “Bob” and “Steve” were inside an *#if 0* block that the preprocessor will exclude from compilation.

- This also provides a convenient way to **“comment out” code that contains multi-line comments**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "Joe\n";
  
  #if 0 // Don't compile anything starting here
      std::cout << "Bob\n";
      /* Some
       * multi-line
       * comment here
       */
      std::cout << "Steve\n";
  #endif // until this point
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```

### Object-like macros don’t affect other preprocessor directives

```cpp
#define PRINT_JOE

#ifdef PRINT_JOE
// ...
```

- Since we **defined *PRINT_JOE* to be nothing**, how come the **preprocessor didn’t replace *PRINT_JOE* in *#ifdef PRINT_JOE* with nothing**?

- **Macros** only cause **text substitution for normal code**. **Other preprocessor commands are ignored.** 

  ```cpp
  #define FOO 9 // Here's a macro substitution
  
  #ifdef FOO // This FOO does not get replaced because it’s part of another preprocessor directive
      std::cout << FOO; // This FOO gets replaced with 9 because it's part of the normal code
  #endif
  ```

## The scope of defines

- **Directives are resolved before compilation**, from top to bottom on a file-by-file basis.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  void foo()
  {
  #define MY_NAME "Alex"
  }
  
  int main()
  {
  	std::cout << "My name is: " << MY_NAME;
  
  	return 0;
  }
  ```

- Even though it looks like ***#define MY_NAME “Alex”* is defined inside function *foo***, the **preprocessor won’t notice**, as **it doesn’t understand C++ concepts like functions**. 
- Therefore, this program **behaves identically to one where *#define MY_NAME “Alex”* was defined either before or immediately after function *foo***. 
- You’ll generally want to **#define identifiers outside of functions.**

- **All defined identifiers from that file are discarded** once the preprocessor has **finished**
- This means that **directives are only valid from the point of definition to the end of the file in which they are defined**. 
- **Directives defined in one code file do not have impact on other code files in the same project.**

Consider the following example:

function.cpp:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void doSomething()
{
#ifdef PRINT
    std::cout << "Printing!";
#endif
#ifndef PRINT
    std::cout << "Not printing!";
#endif
}
```

main.cpp:

```cpp
void doSomething(); // forward declaration for function doSomething()

#define PRINT

int main()
{
    doSomething();

    return 0;
}
```

```
Not printing!
```

- Even though **PRINT was defined in *main.cpp*, that doesn’t have any impact on any of the code in *function.cpp***
