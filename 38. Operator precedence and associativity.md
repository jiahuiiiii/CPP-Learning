# 5.1 — Operator precedence and associativity

- In mathematics, an **operation** is a **mathematical calculation** involving zero or more input values (called **operands**) that produces a new value (called an **output value**). 
- The specific operation to be performed is denoted by a construct (typically a symbol or pair of symbols) called an **operator**.

## Operator precedence

- An **expression that has multiple operators** is called a **compound expression**. 
- The order in which operators are evaluated in a compound expression is determined by an operator’s **precedence**. 
- In C++, **all operators are assigned a level of precedence**. 
- Operators with the **highest level of precedence are evaluated first**.

## Operator associativity

- If two **operators with the same precedence level** are adjacent to each other in an expression, the operator’s **associativity** tells the compiler whether to evaluate the operators from **left to right or from right to left**. 

- Precedence level 1 is the highest precedence level, and level 17 is the lowest. Operators with a higher precedence level get evaluated first.
- L->R means left to right associativity.
- R->L means right to left associativity.

## Parenthesization

- In order to reduce mistakes and make your code easier to understand without referencing a precedence table, it’s a good idea to **parenthesize any non-trivial compound expression**, so it’s clear what your intent is.

## The order of evaluation of expressions and function arguments is mostly unspecified

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int getValue()
{
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

    int x{};
    std::cin >> x;
    return x;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << getValue() + (getValue() * getValue()); // a + (b * c)
    return 0;
}
```

- If you run this program and enter inputs *1*, *2*, and *3*, you might assume that this program would print *7*. 
- But that is making the assumption that the calls to getValue() will evaluate in left-to-right order. The compiler may choose a different order. For example, if the compiler chose a right-to-left order instead, the program would print *5* for the same set of inputs.

- Outside of the operator precedence and associativity rules, assume that the parts of an expression could evaluate in any order. 
- Ensure that the expressions you write are not dependent on the order of evaluation of those parts.

- The above program can be made unambiguous by making each function call a separate statement:

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int getValue()
  {
      std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
  
      int x{};
      std::cin >> x;
      return x;
  }
  
  int main()
  {
      int a{ getValue() }; // will execute first
      int b{ getValue() }; // will execute second
      int c{ getValue() }; // will execute third
  
      std::cout << a + (b * c); // order of eval doesn't matter now
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```
