# 0.2 — Introduction to programming languages

- **Computers must be told exactly what to do**.

- A **computer program** (a.k.a. **application**) is a set of instructions that the computer can perform in order to perform some task. 
- The process of creating a program is called **programming**. 
- Programmers typically create programs by producing **source code** (a.k.a **code**), which is a list of commands typed into one or more text files.

- The collection of **physical computer parts** that make up a computer and **execute programs** is called the **hardware**
- When a computer program is loaded into memory and the hardware sequentially executes each instruction, this is called **running** or **executing** the program.

## Machine Language

- A CPU can understand **machine code** (a.k.a. **machine language** a.k.a. **instruction set**).

- Here is a sample machine language instruction: `10110000 01100001`

- Each **instruction** is composed of a **sequence of 1s and 0s**. 
- Each **individual 0 or 1** is called a **binary digit** (a.k.a **bit**). 
- The **number of bits** that make up a single command vary[^vary].
- Some **CPUs process** instructions that are **always 32 bits long**, whereas some other CPUs (such as the **x86** family) have instructions that can be a **variable[^variable] length**.

- Each set of **binary digits is interpreted by the CPU into a command** to do a **very specific job**, such as *compare these two numbers*, or *put this number in that memory location*. 
- **Different CPUs have different instruction sets**, **programs** generally **weren’t portable** to different types of system.

## Assembly Language

- In an assembly language, each **instruction is identified by a short abbreviation (rather than a set of bits)**, and names and other numbers can be used.

- Here is the same instruction as above in assembly language: `mov al, 061h`. This makes assembly **much easier to read and write than machine language**. 

- An **assembler** can **translate the assembly program into machine language before it can be executed by the computer**. 
- **Programs written in assembly languages** tend to be **very fast**, and assembly **is still used** today **when speed is critical**.

### Downsides of Assembly

- Assembly languages still **require a lot of instructions to do even simple tasks**. 
- While the **individual instructions** themselves are somewhat **human readable**, understanding what an **entire program** is doing **can be challenging** (it’s a bit like trying to understand a sentence by looking at each letter individually).
- Assembly language still **isn’t very portable** -- a program written in assembly would have to be **rewritten or extensively modified** to work on hardware that uses a **different instruction set.**

## High-level Languages

- To address the **readability and portability concerns**, new programming languages such as **C, C++, Pascal (and later, languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Perl)** were developed. 
- These languages are called **high level languages**, as they are designed to **allow the programmer to write programs without having to be as concerned about what kind of computer the program will be run on**.

- Here is the same instruction as above **in C/C++:** `a = 97;`

- Programs written in high level languages **must be translated into a format the computer can understand before they can be run**. 

### Compiling and interpreting

- A **compiler** is a program that **reads source code and produces a stand-alone executable program that can then be run.** 
- Once your **code** has been **turned into an executable**, you **do not need the compiler to run the program**.

- An **interpreter** is a program that **directly executes the instructions in the source code without requiring them to be compiled into an executable first**. 
- Interpreters tend to be **more flexible than compilers**, but are **less efficient** when running programs because the **interpreting process needs to be done every time the program is run**.

- Most languages can be **compiled or interpreted**,
  - **Traditionally languages** like **C, C++, and Pascal are compiled** 
  - **“scripting” languages** like Perl and Javascript tend to be **interpreted**
  - **Java**, use a **mix of the two**(can be compiled or interpreted as long as you're happy lol)

### Advantage of High level languages

- **Much easier to read and write** because the commands are **closer to natural language**.
- **Require fewer instructions** to perform the same task as lower level languages, making programs **more concise and easier to understand**.
  - In C++ you can do something like `a = b * 2 + 5;` in one line. 
  - In assembly language, this would take 5 or 6 different instructions.

- **Programs can be compiled (or interpreted) for many different systems**, you just  need to **recompile** for that CPU

> ![Example of portability](https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Chapter0/Portability-min.png?ezimgfmt=rs:481x261/rscb2/ng:webp/ngcb2)

- There are two general exceptions[^exception] to portability. 

  - **Many operating systems**, such as Microsoft Windows, **contain platform-specific capabilities that you can use in your code**. These can make it **much easier to write a program for a specific operating system**

  - Some compilers also **support compiler-specific extensions**. If you use these, your programs **won’t be able to be compiled by other compilers that don’t support the same extensions** without modification.



## Vocabulary List

> for you in case your English is as suck as mine lel:)

1. [^vary]: If things of the same type vary, they are different from each other, and if you vary them, you cause them to be different from each other.（使）不同；（使）呈现差异v

2. [^variable]: likely to change often 多变的；反复无常的p

3. [^primitive]: relating to human society at a very early stage of development, with people living in a simple way without machines or writing system 原始的，早期的，远古的d

4. [^desirable]: worth having and wanted by most people 值得拥有的；渴望获得的，令人向往的e

5. [^exception]: someone or something that is not included in a rule, group or list or that does not behave in the expected way 除外的人；例外的事物
