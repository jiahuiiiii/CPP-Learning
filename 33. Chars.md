# 4.11 — Chars

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Would you like a burrito? (y/n)";

    // We want the user to enter a 'y' or 'n' character
    // How do we do this?

    return 0;
}
```

- The **char** data type was designed to **hold a `character`.** 
- A **character** can be a ***single* letter, number, symbol, or whitespace**.

- The char data type is an **integral type**, meaning the underlying value is stored as an integer. 
- The **integer stored by a `char` variable** are **interpreted as an `ASCII character`**.

- **ASCII** defines a particular way to represent English characters (plus a few other symbols) as numbers between 0 and 127 (a.k.a. **ASCII code** or **code point**). 

- **Character literals** are always placed between **single quotes** (e.g. ‘g’, ‘1’, ‘ ‘).

- Codes 0-31 are called the **unprintable chars**, and they’re mostly used to do formatting and control printers. Most of these are obsolete now.

- Codes 32-127 are called the **printable characters**, and they **represent the letters, number characters, and punctuation** that most computers use to display basic English text.

## Initializing chars

Initialize char variables using character literals:

```cpp
char ch2{ 'a' }; // initialize with code point for 'a' (stored as integer 97) (preferred)
```

Initialize chars with integers as well, but this should be avoided if possible

```cpp
char ch1{ 97 }; // initialize with integer 97 ('a') (not preferred)
```

Be careful not to mix up **character numbers** with **integer numbers.** The following two initializations are not the same:

```cpp
char ch{5}; // initialize with integer 5 (stored as integer 5)
char ch{'5'}; // initialize with code point for '5' (stored as integer 5)
```

**Character numbers** are intended to be used when we want to **represent numbers as text**, rather than as numbers to apply mathematical operations to.

## Printing chars

When using std::cout to print a char, std::cout **outputs the char variable as an ASCII character**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char ch1{ 'a' }; // (preferred)
    std::cout << ch1; // cout prints character 'a'

    char ch2{ 98 }; // code point for 'b' (not preferred)
    std::cout << ch2; // cout prints a character ('b')


    return 0;
}
```

```
ab
```

Output char literals directly:

```cpp
cout << 'c';
```

```
c
```

## Inputting chars

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Input a keyboard character: ";

    char ch{};
    std::cin >> ch;
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
Input a keyboard character: q
You entered q
```

- std::cin will let you enter **multiple characters**. 
- Variable ***ch* can only hold 1 character**. 
- Consequently, **only the first input character is extracted into variable *ch***. 
- The **rest of the user input** is left in the input buffer that std::cin uses, and can be **extracted with subsequent calls to std::cin**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Input a keyboard character: "; // assume the user enters "abcd" (without quotes)

    char ch{};
    std::cin >> ch; // ch = 'a', "bcd" is left queued.
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';

    // Note: The following cin doesn't ask the user for input, it grabs queued input!
    std::cin >> ch; // ch = 'b', "cd" is left queued.
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
Input a keyboard character: abcd
You entered: a
You entered: b
```

- If you want to **read in more than one char at a time** (e.g. to read in a name, word, or sentence), you’ll want to **use a string instead of a char.** 
- A **string** is a **collection of sequential characters**.

## Char size, range, and default sign

- Char is defined by C++ to always be **1 byte in size**. 
- By default, a **char** may be **signed or unsigned** (though it’s usually signed). 
- If you’re **using chars to hold ASCII characters**, you **don’t need to specify a sign** (since both **signed and unsigned chars** can hold **values between 0 and 127**).

- If you’re **using a char to hold small integers**, you should always s**pecify whether it is signed or unsigned**. 
  - A **signed char** can hold a **number between -128 and 127**. 
  - An **unsigned char** can hold a **number between 0 and 255**.

## Escape sequences

- An **escape sequence starts with a ‘\’ (backslash) character**, and then **a following letter or number.**

- **‘\n’** can be used to **embed a newline in a string of text**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "First line\nSecond line\n";
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  ```
  First line
  Second line
  ```

- **‘\t’ embeds a horizontal tab**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "First part\tSecond part";
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  ```
  First part        Second part
  ```

- Three other notable escape sequences are:
  - **`\’ prints a single quotes**
  - **\” prints a double quote**
  - **\\ prints a backslash**

| Name            | Symbol     | Meaning                                                      |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alert           | \a         | Makes an alert, such as a beep                               |
| Backspace       | \b         | Moves the cursor back one space                              |
| Formfeed        | \f         | Moves the cursor to next logical page                        |
| Newline         | \n         | Moves cursor to next line                                    |
| Carriage return | \r         | Moves cursor to beginning of line                            |
| Horizontal tab  | \t         | Prints a horizontal tab                                      |
| Vertical tab    | \v         | Prints a vertical tab                                        |
| Single quote    | \’         | Prints a single quote                                        |
| Double quote    | \”         | Prints a double quote                                        |
| Backslash       | \\         | Prints a backslash.                                          |
| Question mark   | \?         | Prints a question mark. No longer relevant. You can use question marks unescaped. |
| Octal number    | \(number)  | Translates into char represented by octal                    |
| Hex number      | \x(number) | Translates into char represented by hex number               |

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "\"This is quoted text\"\n";
    std::cout << "This string contains a single backslash \\\n";
    std::cout << "6F in hex is char '\x6F'\n";
    return 0;
}
```

```
"This is quoted text"
This string contains a single backslash \
6F in hex is char 'o'
```

### Difference between putting symbols in single and double quotes

- **Single chars** are always put in **single quotes** (e.g. ‘a’, ‘+’, ‘5’). 

- A char can only **represent one symbol** (e.g. the letter a, the plus symbol, the number 5). Something like this is illegal:

  ```cpp
  char ch{'56'}; // a char can only hold one symbol
  ```

- Text put between **double quotes** (e.g. “Hello, world!”) is treated as a **string**.

  ```cpp
  std::cout << "Hello, world!"; // "Hello, world!" is a string literal
  ```

- **Put stand-alone chars in single quotes** (e.g. ‘t’ or ‘\n’, not “t” or “\n”). 
- This **helps the compiler optimize more effectively**.

### Other char types, wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t?

- **wchar_t** should be **avoided** in almost all cases (except when interfacing with the Windows API). Its size is implementation defined, and is not reliable. It has largely been **deprecated**.

> The term “deprecated” means “still supported, but no longer recommended for use, because it has been replaced by something better or is no longer considered safe”.

- Much like **ASCII maps the integers 0-127 to American English characters**, **other character encoding standards exist to map integers** to characters in other languages. 
- The most well-known mapping outside of ASCII is the **Unicode standard**, which **maps over 144,000 integers to characters in many different languages**. 
- Because Unicode contains so many code points, a single Unicode code point needs 32-bits to represent a character (called UTF-32). 
- However, Unicode characters can also be encoded using multiple 16-bit or 8-bit characters (called UTF-16 and UTF-8 respectively).

- **char16_t** and **char32_t** were added to C++11 to provide explicit **support for 16-bit and 32-bit Unicode characters**. char8_t has been added in C++20.

- You won’t need to use **char8_t, char16_t, or char32_t** unless you’re planning on **making your program Unicode compatible**. 
- In the meantime, **you should only use ASCII characters when working with characters** (and strings). **Using characters from other character sets may cause your characters to display incorrectly.**
