# 4.7 — Introduction to scientific notation

- **Scientific notation** is a useful shorthand for writing lengthy numbers in a concise manner. 

- Numbers in scientific notation take the following form: ***significand* x 10*exponent***. 
- For example, in the scientific notation `1.2 x 10⁴`, **`1.2` is the significand** and **`4` is the exponent**. 

- By convention, **numbers in scientific notation are written with one digit before the decimal point**, and the rest of the digits afterward.

- In **decimal notation**, we’d write the mass of the Earth.as `5973600000000000000000000 kg`. 

- In **scientific notation**, this would be written as `5.9736 x 10²⁴ kg`, which is much easier to read. 
- Scientific notation has the added benefit of making it **easier to compare the magnitude of two really large or really small numbers simply by comparing the exponent**.

- Because it can be hard to type or display exponents in C++, we use the letter ‘e’ (or sometimes ‘E’) to represent the “times 10 to the power of” part of the equation. For example, `1.2 x 10⁴` would be written as `1.2e4`, and `5.9736 x 10²⁴` would be written as `5.9736e24`.

- For numbers smaller than 1, the exponent can be negative. The number `5e-2` is equivalent to `5 * 10⁻²`, which is `5 / 10²`, or `0.05`. The mass of an electron is `9.1093822e-31 kg`.

How to convert numbers to scientific notation

```
Start with: 42030
Slide decimal left 4 spaces: 4.2030e4
No leading zeros to trim: 4.2030e4
Trim trailing zeros: 4.203e4 (4 significant digits)

Start with: 0.0078900
Slide decimal right 3 spaces: 0007.8900e-3
Trim leading zeros: 7.8900e-3
Don't trim trailing zeros: 7.8900e-3 (5 significant digits)

Start with: 600.410
Slide decimal left 2 spaces: 6.00410e2
No leading zeros to trim: 6.00410e2
Don't trim trailing zeros: 6.00410e2 (6 significant digits)
```

- The **digits in the significand (the part before the ‘e’)** are called the **significant digits**. 
- The **number of significant digits** defines a number’s **precision**. 
- The **more digits in the significand**, the **more precise a number is**.

## Precision and trailing zeros after the decimal

- So in standard scientific notation, we **prefer to keep trailing zeros after a decimal point**, because those digits **impart useful information about the precision of the number**.

- In C++, **87 and 87.000 are treated exactly the same**, and the compiler will store the same value for each. 
- There’s no technical reason why we should prefer one over the other.
