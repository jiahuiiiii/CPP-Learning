# 1.4 — Variable assignment and initialization

- Here’s a short snippet that **first allocates a single integer variable named *x***, then **allocates two more integer variables named *y* and *z***:

```cpp
int x; // define an integer variable named x
int y, z; // define two integer variables, named y and z
```

## Variable assignment

- After a variable has been defined, you can give it a value (in a separate statement) **using the *= operator***. This process is called **copy assignment** (or just **assignment**) for short.

```cpp
int width; // define an integer variable named width
width = 5; // copy assignment of value 5 into variable width

// variable width now has value 5
```

- Copy assignment is named such because it **copies the value on the right-hand side of the *= operator* to the variable on the left-hand side of the operator**. 
- The ***= operator*** is called the **assignment operator**.

Here’s an example where we use assignment twice:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	int width;
	width = 5; // copy assignment of value 5 into variable width

	// variable width now has value 5

	width = 7; // change value stored in variable width to 7

	// variable width now has value 7

	return 0;
}
```

- When we assign value 7 to variable *width*, the value 5 that was there previously is **overwritten**. **Normal variables can only hold one value at a time**.

- One of the most common mistakes that new programmers make is to **confuse the assignment operator (`=`) with the equality operator (`==`)**. **Assignment** (`=`) is used to **assign a value to a variable**. **Equality** (`==`) is used to **test whether two operands are equal in value**.

## Initialization

- One downside of assignment is that it **requires at least two statements**: **one to define the variable, and one to assign the value.**

- These **two steps can be combined**. When a variable is defined, **you can also provide an initial value for the variable at the same time**. This is called **initialization**. The **value used to initialize a variable** is called an **initializer**.

- Initialization in C++ is surprisingly complex, so we’ll present a simplified view here.

There are **4 basic ways to initialize variables in C++**:

```cpp
int a; // no initializer
int b = 5; // initializer after equals sign
int c( 6 ); // initializer in parenthesis
int d { 7 }; // initializer in braces
```

- You may see the **above forms written with different spacing** (e.g. `int d{7};`). Whether you use extra spaces for readability or not is a matter of personal preference.

#### **Default initialization**

When **no initialization value is provided** (such as for variable *a* above), this is called **default initialization**. In most cases, default initialization leaves a variable with an indeterminate value. 

#### **Copy initialization**

- When an **initializer is provided after an equals sign**, this is called **copy initialization**. 
- Copy initialization **was inherited from the C language**.

```cpp
int width = 5; // copy initialization of value 5 into variable width
```

- Much like copy assignment, this **copies the value on the right-hand side of the equals to the variable being created on the left-hand side.**

For **simple types like int**, **copy initialization is efficient**. However, when **types get more complex**, **copy initialization can be inefficient**.

#### **Direct initialization**

- When an **initializer is provided inside parenthesis**, this is called **direct initialization**.

```cpp
int width( 5 ); // direct initialization of value 5 into variable width
```

- For **simple data types (like int)**, **copy and direct initialization are essentially the same**. 
- For more **complicated types**, **direct initialization tends to be more efficient than copy initialization.**

#### **Brace initialization**

- Unfortunately, **direct initialization can’t be used for all types of initialization** (such as **initializing an object with a list of data**). 
- To provide a **more consistent initialization mechanism**, there’s **brace initialization** (also called **uniform initialization** or **list initialization**) that uses curly braces.

Brace initialization comes in three forms:

```cpp
int width { 5 }; // direct brace initialization of value 5 into variable width (preferred)
int height = { 6 }; // copy brace initialization of value 6 into variable height
int depth {}; // value initialization (see next section)
```

- **Direct and copy brace initialization function almost identically**, but the **direct form is generally preferred**.

- **Brace initialization** has the added benefit of disallowing **“narrowing” conversions**. This means that **if you try to use brace initialization to initialize a variable with a value it can not safely hold, the compiler will throw a warning or an error**. 

```cpp
int width { 4.5 }; // error: not all double values fit into an int
```

- In the above snippet, we’re **trying to assign a number (4.5) that has a fractional part (the .5 part) to an integer variable** (which can only hold numbers without fractional parts). 
- **Copy and direct initialization** would **drop the fractional part**, resulting in initialization of value 4 into variable *width*. 
- However, with **brace initialization**, this will **cause the compiler to issue an error**. Conversions that can be done **without potential data loss are allowed**.

> Favor initialization using **braces** whenever possible.

- C++ provides copy, direct, and brace initialization, and copy assignment, but doesn't support direct or brace assignment syntax.

### Value initialization and zero initialization

- When a **variable is initialized with empty braces**, **value initialization** takes place. 
- In most cases, **value initialization** will **initialize the variable to zero** (or empty, if that’s more appropriate for a given type). 
- In such cases **where zeroing occurs**, this is called **zero initialization**.

```cpp
int width {}; // zero initialization to value 0
```

Q: When should I initialize with { 0 } vs {}?

Use an explicit initialization value if you’re actually using that value.

```cpp
int x { 0 }; // explicit initialization to value 0
std::cout << x; // we're using that zero value
```

Use value initialization if the value is temporary and will be replaced.

```cpp
int x {}; // value initialization
std::cin >> x; // we're immediately replacing that value
```

> Initialize your variables upon creation.

## Initializing multiple variables

In the last section, we noted that **it is possible to define multiple variables *of the same type* in a single statement by separating the names with a comma**:

```cpp
int a, b;
```

- We also noted that best practice is to **avoid this syntax altogether**. 
- However, since you **may encounter other code that uses this style**, it’s still useful to talk a little bit more about it, if for no other reason than to reinforce some of the reasons you should be avoiding it.

You can initialize multiple variables defined on the same line:

```cpp
int a = 5, b = 6; // copy initialization
int c( 7 ), d( 8 ); // direct initialization
int e { 9 }, f { 10 }; // brace initialization (preferred)
```

Unfortunately, there’s a **common pitfall** here that can occur when the **programmer mistakenly tries to initialize both variables by using one initialization statement**:

```cpp
int a, b = 5; // wrong (a is not initialized!)

int a = 5, b = 5; // correct
```

In the top statement, **variable “a” will be left uninitialized**, and the compiler may or may not complain. If it doesn’t, this is a great way to have your program *intermittently crash and produce sporadic results.* 

The best way to remember that **this is wrong is to consider the case of direct initialization or brace initialization**:

```cpp
int a, b( 5 );
int c, d{ 5 };
```

This makes it seem a little more clear that the **value 5 is only being used to initialize variable *b* or *d***, not *a* or *c*.
