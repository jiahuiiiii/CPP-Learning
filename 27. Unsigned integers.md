# 4.5 — Unsigned integers, and why to avoid them

## Unsigned integers

- **Signed integers** is a set of **types that can hold positive and negative whole numbers, including 0**.

- **Unsigned integers** are integers that can only **hold non-negative whole numbers**.

## Defining unsigned integers

- Use the ***unsigned* keyword** to **define an unsigned integer**.

- ```cpp
  unsigned short us;
  unsigned int ui;
  unsigned long ul;
  unsigned long long ull;
  ```

## Unsigned integer range

| Size/Type       | Range                           |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------ |
| 1 byte unsigned | 0 to 255                        |
| 2 byte unsigned | 0 to 65,535                     |
| 4 byte unsigned | 0 to 4,294,967,295              |
| 8 byte unsigned | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |

- An **n-bit unsigned variable** has a **range of 0 to (2n)-1.**

- When **no negative numbers are required**, unsigned integers are **well-suited for networking and systems with little memory**, because unsigned integers can **store more positive numbers without taking up extra memory**.

- An **integer with a sign (a signed integer) can tell the difference between positive and negative**. 
- An **integer without a sign (an unsigned integer) assumes all values are positive**.

## Unsigned integer overflow

> “a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow”. 

- If an unsigned value is out of range, it is **divided by one greater than the largest number of the type**, and only **the remainder kept**.

- The **number 280 is too big to fit in our 1-byte range of 0 to 255**. 1 greater than the largest number of the type is 256. Therefore, we **divide 280 by 256**, getting 1 **remainder 24**. The **remainder of 24 is what is stored**.

- Any number bigger than the largest number representable by the type simply “wraps around” (a.k.a. “modulo wrapping”). 
- **255 is in range of a 1-byte integer**, so 255 is fine. **256, however, is outside the range**, so it **wraps around to the value 0**. 
- **257 wraps around to the value 1**. **280 wraps around to the value 24**.

Let’s take a look at this using 2-byte shorts:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    unsigned short x{ 65535 }; // largest 16-bit unsigned value possible
    std::cout << "x was: " << x << '\n';

    x = 65536; // 65536 is out of our range, so we get wrap-around
    std::cout << "x is now: " << x << '\n';

    x = 65537; // 65537 is out of our range, so we get wrap-around
    std::cout << "x is now: " << x << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
x was: 65535
x is now: 0
x is now: 1
```

- It’s possible to wrap around the other direction as well**.**
- **0 is representable in a 2-byte unsigned integer**, so that’s fine. **-1 is not representable**, so it **wraps around to the top of the range**, producing the **value 65535.** **-2 wraps around to 65534**. And so forth.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    unsigned short x{ 0 }; // smallest 2-byte unsigned value possible
    std::cout << "x was: " << x << '\n';

    x = -1; // -1 is out of our range, so we get wrap-around
    std::cout << "x is now: " << x << '\n';

    x = -2; // -2 is out of our range, so we get wrap-around
    std::cout << "x is now: " << x << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```
x was: 0
x is now: 65535
x is now: 65534
```

## The controversy over unsigned numbers

- Many developers believe that **developers should generally avoid unsigned integers**.

- This is largely because of two behaviors that can cause problems.

- First, consider the **subtraction of two unsigned numbers**, such as 3 and 5. 3 minus 5 is -2, but **-2 can’t be represented as an unsigned number**.

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  int main()
  {
  	unsigned int x{ 3 };
  	unsigned int y{ 5 };
  
  	std::cout << x - y << '\n';
  	return 0;
  }
  ```

- This occurs due to **-2 wrapping around to a number close to the top of the range of a 4-byte integer**.
- Another common **unwanted wrap-around** happens when an **unsigned integer is repeatedly decremented by 1** (using the `--` operator).

- Second, **unexpected behavior** can result when you **mix signed and unsigned integers**. 
- In a **mathematical operation** in C++ (e.g. arithmetic or comparison), if **one signed and one unsigned integer are used**, the **signed integer will be converted to unsigned**. And because **unsigned integers can not store negative numbers, this can result in loss of data**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    signed int s { -1 };
    unsigned int u { 1 };

    if (s < u) // -1 is implicitly converted to 4294967295, and 4294967295 < 1 is false
        std::cout << "-1 is less than 1\n";
    else
        std::cout << "1 is less than -1\n"; // this statement executes

    return 0;
}
```

- This program is well formed, compiles, and is logically consistent to the eye. But it prints the wrong answer. 

------

```cpp
void doSomething(unsigned int x)
{
    // Run some code x times

    std::cout << "x is " << x << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    doSomething(-1);

    return 0;
}
```

- The **signed argument of *-1* gets implicitly converted to an unsigned parameter**. 
- -1 isn’t in the range of an unsigned number, so it wraps around to some large number (probably 4294967295). Then your program goes ballistic. 
- C++ will freely convert between signed and unsigned numbers, but it won’t do any range checking to make sure you don’t overflow your type.

------

- All of these problems are **commonly encountered,** produce **unexpected behavior**, and **are hard to find**.

- Given the above, the somewhat controversial best practice that we’ll advocate for is to **avoid unsigned types except in specific circumstances**.

- There are still a few cases in C++ where it’s okay / necessary to use unsigned numbers.
  - First, unsigned numbers are **preferred when dealing with bit manipulation**. 
  - They are also **useful when well-defined wrap-around behavior is required** (useful in some **algorithms** like **encryption** and **random number generation**).
  - Second, use of unsigned numbers is still **unavoidable** in some cases, mainly those having to do with **array indexing**. 
  - Also note that if you’re developing for an **embedded system** (e.g. an Arduino) or some other **processor/memory limited context**, **use of unsigned numbers is more common and accepted** (and in some cases, **unavoidable**) for **performance reasons.**
