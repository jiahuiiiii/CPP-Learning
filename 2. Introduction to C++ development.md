## Step 1: Define the problem that you would like to solve

1. Figure out **what problem you are intending to solve**. 
2. Coming up with the **initial idea** for what you would like to program can be the **easiest step**

> Here are a few examples:
>
> - “I want to write a program that will allow me to enter many numbers, then calculates the average.”
> - “I want to write a program that generates a 2d maze and lets the user navigate through it. The user wins if they reach the end.”
> - “I want to write a program that reads in a file of stock prices and predicts whether the stock will go up or down.”

## Step 2: Determine how you are going to solve the problem

### Characteristics of Good Solutions:

- **straightforward** (not overly complicated or confusing).
- **well documented** (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
- **built modularly**, so parts can be reused or changed later **without impacting other parts of the program**.
- **robust**[^robust], and can recover or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.

When you sit down and **start coding right away**, you’re typically thinking “I want to do <something>”, so you implement the solution that gets you there the fastest. This can lead to programs that are **fragile, hard to change or extend later**, or have lots of **bugs** (technical defects).

> The term *bug* was first used by Thomas Edison back in the 1870s! However, the term was popularized in the 1940s when engineers found an actual moth stuck in the hardware of an early computer, causing a short circuit. Both the log book in which the error was reported and the moth are now part of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. It can be viewed [here](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334663).

- Only 20% of a programmer’s time is actually spent writing the initial program. The other **80%** is spent on **maintenance**, which can consist of **debugging** (removing bugs), **updates to cope with changes in the environment** (e.g. to run on a new OS version), **enhancements**[^enhancements] (minor changes to improve usability or capability), or **internal improvements** (to increase reliability or maintainability).

- **Spend a little extra time before you start coding thinking about the best way** to tackle a problem, what assumptions[^assumptions] you are making, and how you might plan for the future, in order to save yourself a lot of time and trouble down the road.

## Step 3: Write the program

- To write a program, we need: 
  - **knowledge of a programming language** 
  - a **text editor** to write and save our written programs. 

### Text Editor

- The **programs** we write using C++ instructions are called **source code** (a.k.a. **code**). 
- It’s possible to write a program using **any text editor** you want, even something as simple as **Window’s notepad** (wtf nononono don't ever think of coding using notepad lol).
- We strongly urge[^urge] you to use an editor that is **designed for programming** (a.k.a. **code editor**). 

#### Typical Text Editor Features that makes your life much easier

1. **Line numbering**. Line numbering is **useful when the compiler gives us an error**, as a typical compiler error will state: *some error code/message, line 64*.

2. **Syntax highlighting and coloring**. It changes the color of various parts of your program to **make it easier to identify the different components** of your program. 

2. An **unambiguous[^unambiguous ] font**. 

    - Non-programming fonts often make it hard to distinguish between the **number 0 and the letter O**, or between the **number 1, the letter l (lower case L)**, and **the letter I (upper case i)**. 
    - A good programming font will ensure these symbols are **visually differentiated** in order to ensure one isn’t accidentally used in place of the other. 

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main()
    {
        std::cout << "Colored text!";
        return 0;
    }
    ```

- The programs you write will typically be **named *something.cpp***
  - ***something*** is replaced with **the name of your choosing for the program**.
  - The ***.cpp* extension** tells the compiler that this is a **C++ source code file that contains C++ instructions**. 

## Step 4: Compiling your source code

- In order to **compile a C++ program**, we use a **C++ compiler**. 
- The C++ compiler sequentially[^sequential] goes through each source code (.cpp) file in your program and does two important tasks:
  - Checks your code to **make sure it follows the rules of the C++ language**. If it does **not**, the compiler will **give you an error** (and the corresponding **line number**) until the error is fixed.
  - It **translates your C++ source code into a machine language file** called an **object file**. Object files are typically named *name.o* or *name.obj*, where *name* is the same name as the .cpp file it was produced from.

> If your program had 3 .cpp files, the compiler would generate 3 object files:

## Step 5: Linking object files and libraries

- After the **compiler creates one or more object files**, then another program called the **linker** kicks in. The job of the linker is three fold:

  1. **take all the object files generated by the compiler and combine them into a single executable program**.

     ![The linking process](https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Chapter0/LinkingObjects-min.png?ezimgfmt=rs:441x271/rscb2/ng:webp/ngcb2)

  2. The linker also is capable of linking library files. 

     - A **library file** is a **collection of precompiled code** that has been “packaged up” for **reuse in other programs**.
     - C++ comes with an extensive library called the **C++ Standard Library** (a.k.a. *standard library*) that provides **additional functionality** that you can use in your programs. 
     - One of the most commonly used standard library is the ***iostream library***
       - Contains **functionality for printing text on a monitor and getting keyboard input from a user**. 
       - it’s very **common for the standard library to get linked into your programs**. 

  3. The linker **makes sure all cross-file dependencies are resolved properly**. 

     - If you define something in one .cpp file, and then use it in *another* .cpp file, the **linker connects the two together**. If the linker is **unable to connect a reference to something with its definition**, you’ll get a **linker error**, and the linking process will abort.

- Once **the linker is finished linking all the object files and libraries** (assuming all goes well), you will have **an executable file** that you can then run.

#### Makefile

- For complex projects, some development environments use a **makefile**, which is a file that **describes how to build a program** (e.g. which files to compile and link, or otherwise process in various ways). 

## Steps 6 & 7: Testing and Debugging

- If your program runs but **doesn’t work correctly**, then it’s time for some debugging to figure out what’s wrong. 

## Integrated development environments (IDEs)

Note that steps 3, 4, 5, and 7 all involve software (editor, compiler, linker, debugger). While you can use separate programs for each of these activities, a **software package** known as an **integrated development environment (IDE) bundles and integrates all of these features together**.
