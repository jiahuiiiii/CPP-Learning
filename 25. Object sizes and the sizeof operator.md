# 4.3 — Object sizes and the sizeof operator

## Object sizes

- **Memory** on modern machines is typically **organized into byte-sized units**, with e**ach byte of memory having a unique address**. 
- Most **objects** actually take up **more than 1 byte of memory**. 
- A single object may use 2, 4, 8, or even more **consecutive memory addresses**. 
- The **amount of memory** that an object uses is based on its **data type**.

- Because we typically **access memory through variable names** (and **not directly via memory addresses**), the compiler is able to hide the details of how many bytes a given object uses from us. 

- Even so, there are several reasons it is useful to know how much memory an object uses.

## The more memory an object uses, the more information it can hold

A single bit can hold 2 possible values, a 0, or a 1:

| bit 0 |
| :---- |
| 0     |
| 1     |

2 bits can hold 4 possible values:

| bit 0 | bit 1 |
| :---- | :---- |
| 0     | 0     |
| 0     | 1     |
| 1     | 0     |
| 1     | 1     |

3 bits can hold 8 possible values:

| bit 0 | bit 1 | bit 2 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 0     | 0     | 1     |
| 0     | 1     | 0     |
| 0     | 1     | 1     |
| 1     | 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 0     | 1     |
| 1     | 1     | 0     |
| 1     | 1     | 1     |

- An object with *n* bits (where n is an integer) can hold 2^n^ (2 to the power of n, also commonly written 2^n) unique values. 
- Therefore, with an **8-bit byte**, a byte-sized object can **hold 2^8^ (256) different values**. 
- An object that uses **2 bytes can hold 2^16^ (65536) different values**.

- Thus, the **size of the object puts a limit on the amount of unique values it can store** -- objects that utilize more bytes can **store a larger number of unique values**.

- For programs that need a large amount of objects or data (e.g. a game that is rendering millions of polygons), the **difference between using 1 byte and 8 byte objects can be significant**.

## Fundamental data type sizes

- C++ only guarantees that each **fundamental data types will have a minimum size**

| Category       | Type        | Minimum Size | Note                  |
| :------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :-------------------- |
| boolean        | bool        | 1 byte       |                       |
| character      | char        | 1 byte       | Always exactly 1 byte |
|                | wchar_t     | 1 byte       |                       |
|                | char16_t    | 2 bytes      |                       |
|                | char32_t    | 4 bytes      |                       |
| integer        | short       | 2 bytes      |                       |
|                | int         | 2 bytes      |                       |
|                | long        | 4 bytes      |                       |
|                | long long   | 8 bytes      |                       |
| floating point | float       | 4 bytes      |                       |
|                | double      | 8 bytes      |                       |
|                | long double | 8 bytes      |                       |

- However, the **actual size of the variables may be different on your machine** (particularly int, which is more often 4 bytes).

- For maximum compatibility, you shouldn’t assume that variables are larger than the specified minimum size.

- Objects of fundamental data types are generally extremely fast.

## The sizeof operator

- In order to d**etermine the size of data types on a particular machine**, C++ provides an **operator named *sizeof***. 
- The **sizeof operator** is a **unary operator** that **takes either a type or a variable, and returns its size in bytes**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "bool:\t\t" << sizeof(bool) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "char:\t\t" << sizeof(char) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "wchar_t:\t" << sizeof(wchar_t) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "char16_t:\t" << sizeof(char16_t) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "char32_t:\t" << sizeof(char32_t) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "short:\t\t" << sizeof(short) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "int:\t\t" << sizeof(int) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "long:\t\t" << sizeof(long) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "long long:\t" << sizeof(long long) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "float:\t\t" << sizeof(float) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "double:\t\t" << sizeof(double) << " bytes\n";
    std::cout << "long double:\t" << sizeof(long double) << " bytes\n";

    return 0;
}
```

```
bool:           1 bytes
char:           1 bytes
wchar_t:        2 bytes
char16_t:       2 bytes
char32_t:       4 bytes
short:          2 bytes
int:            4 bytes
long:           4 bytes
long long:      8 bytes
float:          4 bytes
double:         8 bytes
long double:    12 bytes
```

- Your results may vary if you are using a **different type of machine, or a different compiler.** 
- Note that you **can not use the *sizeof* operator on the *void* type**, since it has no size (doing so will cause a **compile error**).

You can also use the *sizeof* operator on a **variable name**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int x{};
    std::cout << "x is " << sizeof(x) << " bytes\n";

    return 0;
}
```

```
x is 4 bytes
```

## Fundamental data type performance

- On modern machines, objects of the fundamental data types are fast, so performance while using these types should generally not be a concern.

- You might assume that types that use less memory would be faster than types that use more memory. 
- This is not always true. CPUs are often optimized to process data of a certain size (e.g. 32 bits), and types that match that size may be processed quicker. 
- On such a machine, a 32-bit *int* could be faster than a 16-bit *short* or an 8-bit *char*.
