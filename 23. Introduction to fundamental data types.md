# 4.1 — Introduction to fundamental data types

## Bits, bytes, and memory addressing

- Variables are names for a piece of memory that can be used to store information. 
- To recap briefly, computers have random access memory (RAM) that is available for programs to use. 
- When a variable is defined, a piece of that memory is set aside for that variable.

- The **smallest unit of memory** is a **binary digit** (also called a **bit**), which can **hold a value of 0 or 1.** 

- **Memory** is **organized into sequential units** called **memory addresses** (a.k.a addresses). 
- The memory address **allows us to find and access the contents of memory at a particular location.**

- **Each memory address holds 1 byte of data**. 
- A **byte** is **a group of bits that are operated on as a unit**. 
- The modern standard is that **a byte is comprised of 8 sequential bits.**
- Some **older or non-standard machines may have bytes of a different size** (from 1 to 48 bits).

- In C++, we typically work with “**byte-sized” chunks of data.**

## **Data types**

- All **data** on a computer is just a **sequence of bits,** we use a **data type** to tell the **compiler** how to **interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way.** 

- If you **assign an integer object the value *65***, that **value is converted to the sequence of bits `0100 0001`** and **stored in the memory assigned to the object**.

- When the **object is evaluated to produce a value**, that sequence of **bits is reconstituted back into the original value**. Meaning that **`0100 0001` is converted back into the value *65***.

### Fundamental data types

- C++ comes with built-in support for many different data types. 
- These are called **fundamental data types**, but are often informally called **basic types**, **primitive types**, or **built-in types**.

| Types                                                        | Category             | Meaning                                          | Example |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| float/double/long double                                     | Floating Point       | a number with a fractional part                  | 3.14159 |
| bool                                                         | Integral (Boolean)   | true or false                                    | true    |
| char/wchar_t/char8_t (C++20) char16_t (C++11)/char32_t (C++11) | Integral (Character) | a single character of text                       | ‘c’     |
| short/int/long/long long (C++11)                             | Integral (Integer)   | positive and negative whole numbers, including 0 | 64      |
| std::nullptr_t (C++11)                                       | Null Pointer         | a null pointer                                   | nullptr |
| void                                                         | Void                 | no type                                          | n/a     |

- C++ also supports a number of other **more complex types**, called ***compound types*.** 

- The terms `integer` and `integral` are similar, but have different meanings. 
- An `integer` is **a specific data type that hold non-fractional numbers**.
- `Integral` means **“like an integer”**. Most often, `integral` is used as part of the term `integral type`, which includes all of the **Boolean, characters, and integer types.** 
- `Integral type` are named so because they are **stored in memory as integers**.

- Most **modern programming languages** include a **fundamental `string` type**. 
- In C++, **strings aren’t a fundamental type** (they’re **a compound type**). 

#### The _t suffix

- Many of the types defined in newer versions of C++ (e.g. std::nullptr_t) use a **_t suffix.** 
- This suffix means “**type**”, and it’s a **common nomenclature applied to modern types.**

- If you see **something with a _t suffix**, it’s probably **a type**. 
- Buts **many types don’t have a _t suffix**, so this isn’t consistently applied.
